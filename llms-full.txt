## 2025-08-05

**Adding gpt-oss models to our catalog**

* Check out the [blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/openai-gpt-oss-on-workers-ai) for more details about the new models
* Take a look at the [`gpt-oss-120b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-120b) and [`gpt-oss-20b`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/gpt-oss-20b) model pages for more information about schemas, pricing, and context windows

## 2025-04-09

**Pricing correction for @cf/myshell-ai/melotts**

* We've updated our documentation to reflect the correct pricing for melotts: $0.0002 per audio minute, which is actually cheaper than initially stated. The documented pricing was incorrect, where it said users would be charged based on input tokens.

## 2025-03-17

**Minor updates to the model schema for llama-3.2-1b-instruct, whisper-large-v3-turbo, llama-guard**

* [llama-3.2-1b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-1b-instruct/) - updated context window to the accurate 60,000
* [whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/whisper-large-v3-turbo/) - new hyperparameters available
* [llama-guard-3-8b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/) - the messages array must alternate between `user` and `assistant` to function correctly

## 2025-02-21

**Workers AI bug fixes**

* We fixed a bug where `max_tokens` defaults were not properly being respected - `max_tokens` now correctly defaults to `256` as displayed on the model pages. Users relying on the previous behaviour may observe this as a breaking change. If you want to generate more tokens, please set the `max_tokens` parameter to what you need.
* We updated model pages to show context windows - which is defined as the tokens used in the prompt + tokens used in the response. If your prompt + response tokens exceed the context window, the request will error. Please set `max_tokens` accordingly depending on your prompt length and the context window length to ensure a successful response.

## 2024-09-26

We will be deprecating `@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8` on 2024-06-30.

Replace the model ID in your code with a new model of your choice:

* [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/) is the newest model in the Llama family (and is currently free for a limited time on Workers AI).
* [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq/) is the new Llama 3 in a similar precision to your currently selected model. This model is also currently free for a limited time.

If you do not switch to a different model by June 30th, we will automatically start returning inference from `@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct-awq`.

## 2024-05-29

**Add new public LoRAs and note on LoRA routing**

* Added documentation on [new public LoRAs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/fine-tunes/public-loras/).
* Noted that you can now run LoRA inference with the base model rather than explicitly calling the `-lora` version

## 2024-05-17

**Add OpenAI compatible API endpoints**

Added OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## 2024-04-11

**Add AI native binding**

* Added new AI native binding, you can now run models with `const resp = await env.AI.run(modelName, inputs)`
* Deprecated `@cloudflare/ai` npm package. While existing solutions using the @cloudflare/ai package will continue to work, no new Workers AI features will be supported. Moving to native AI bindings is highly recommended

Asynchronous batch processing lets you send a collection (batch) of inference requests in a single call. Instead of expecting immediate responses for every request, the system queues them for processing and returns the results later.

Batch processing is useful for large workloads such as summarization or embeddings when there is no human interaction. Using the batch API will guarantee that your requests are fulfilled eventually, rather than erroring out if Cloudflare does have enough capacity at a given time.

When you send a batch request, the API immediately acknowledges receipt with a status like `queued` and provides a unique `request_id`. This ID is later used to poll for the final responses once the processing is complete.

You can use the Batch API by either creating and deploying a Cloudflare Worker that leverages the [Batch API with the AI binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/batch-api/workers-binding/), using the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/batch-api/rest-api/) directly or by starting from a [template](https://github.com/craigsdennis/batch-please-workers-ai).

Note

Ensure that the total payload is under 10 MB.

## Demo application

If you want to get started quickly, click the button below:

[![Deploy to Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/craigsdennis/batch-please-workers-ai)

This will create a repository in your GitHub account and deploy a ready-to-use Worker that demonstrates how to use Cloudflare's Asynchronous Batch API. The template includes preconfigured AI bindings, and examples for sending and retrieving batch requests with and without external references. Once deployed, you can visit the live Worker and start experimenting with the Batch API immediately.

## What is fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is a general term for modifying an AI model by continuing to train it with additional data. The goal of fine-tuning is to increase the probability that a generation is similar to your dataset. Training a model from scratch is not practical for many use cases given how expensive and time consuming they can be to train. By fine-tuning an existing pre-trained model, you benefit from its capabilities while also accomplishing your desired task.

[Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) (LoRA) is a specific fine-tuning method that can be applied to various model architectures, not just LLMs. It is common that the pre-trained model weights are directly modified or fused with additional fine-tune weights in traditional fine-tuning methods. LoRA, on the other hand, allows for the fine-tune weights and pre-trained model to remain separate, and for the pre-trained model to remain unchanged. The end result is that you can train models to be more accurate at specific tasks, such as generating code, having a specific personality, or generating images in a specific style.

Function calling enables people to take Large Language Models (LLMs) and use the model response to execute functions or interact with external APIs. The developer usually defines a set of functions and the required input schema for each function, which we call `tools`. The model then intelligently understands when it needs to do a tool call, and it returns a JSON output which the user needs to feed to another function or API.

In essence, function calling allows you to perform actions with LLMs by executing code or making additional API calls.

## How can I use function calling?

Workers AI has [embedded function calling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/function-calling/embedded/) which allows you to execute function code alongside your inference calls. We have a package called [`@cloudflare/ai-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/ai-utils) to help facilitate this, which we have open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai-utils).

For industry-standard function calling, take a look at the documentation on [Traditional Function Calling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/function-calling/traditional/).

To show you the value of embedded function calling, take a look at the example below that compares traditional function calling with embedded function calling. Embedded function calling allowed us to cut down the lines of code from 77 to 31.

* Embedded

  ```sh
  # The ai-utils package enables embedded function calling

## What models support function calling?

There are open-source models which have been fine-tuned to do function calling. When browsing our [model catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/), look for models with the function calling property beside it. For example, [@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b/) is a fine-tuned variant of Mistral 7B that you can use for function calling.

When we want text-generation AI models to interact with databases, services, and external systems programmatically, typically when using tool calling or building AI agents, we must have structured response formats rather than natural language.

Workers AI supports JSON Mode, enabling applications to request a structured output response when interacting with AI models.

## Schema

JSON Mode is compatible with OpenAI’s implementation; to enable add the `response_format` property to the request object using the following convention:

```json
{
  response_format: {
    title: "JSON Mode",
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      type: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["json_object", "json_schema"],
      },
      json_schema: {},
    }
  }
}
```

Where `json_schema` must be a valid [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) declaration.

## JSON Mode example

When using JSON Format, pass the schema as in the example below as part of the request you send to the LLM.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "Extract data about a country."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Tell me about India."
    }
  ],
  "response_format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "json_schema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "capital": {
          "type": "string"
        },
        "languages": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          }
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "name",
        "capital",
        "languages"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The LLM will follow the schema, and return a response such as below:

```json
{
  "response": {
    "name": "India",
    "capital": "New Delhi",
    "languages": [
      "Hindi",
      "English",
      "Bengali",
      "Telugu",
      "Marathi",
      "Tamil",
      "Gujarati",
      "Urdu",
      "Kannada",
      "Odia",
      "Malayalam",
      "Punjabi",
      "Sanskrit"
    ]
  }
}
```

As you can see, the model is complying with the JSON schema definition in the request and responding with a validated JSON object.

## Supported Models

This is the list of models that now support JSON Mode:

* [@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct-fast/)
* [@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-70b-instruct/)
* [@cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast/)
* [@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/)
* [@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/)
* [@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct/)
* [@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b/)
* [@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq/)
* [@cf/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b/)

We will continue extending this list to keep up with new, and requested models.

Note that Workers AI can't guarantee that the model responds according to the requested JSON Schema. Depending on the complexity of the task and adequacy of the JSON Schema, the model may not be able to satisfy the request in extreme situations. If that's the case, then an error `JSON Mode couldn't be met` is returned and must be handled.

JSON Mode currently doesn't support streaming.

[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is essential for text generation and large language models (LLMs) in training and inference because it can provide structured, semantic, human, and machine-readable input. Likewise, Markdown facilitates chunking and structuring input data for better retrieval and synthesis in the context of RAGs, and its simplicity and ease of parsing and rendering make it ideal for AI Agents.

For these reasons, document conversion plays an important role when designing and developing AI applications. Workers AI provides the `toMarkdown` utility method that developers can use from the [`env.AI`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/) binding or the REST APIs for quick, easy, and convenient conversion and summary of documents in multiple formats to Markdown language.

## Methods

### async env.AI.toMarkdown()

Takes a document or list of documents in different formats and converts them to Markdown.

#### Parameter

* `files`: MarkdownDocument | MarkdownDocument\[]- an instance of or an array of `MarkdownDocument`s.

#### Return values

* `results`: Promise\<ConversionResult | ConversionResult\[]>- An instance of or an array of `ConversionResult`s.

  * The detected [mime type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types/Common_types) of the document.

* `tokens` number

  * The estimated number of tokens of the converted document. Only present if `format` is equal to `markdown`.

* `data` string

  * The content of the converted document in Markdown format. Only present if `format` is equal to `markdown`.

* `error` string

  * The error message explaining why this conversion failed. Only present if `format` is equal to `error`.

### async env.AI.toMarkdown().transform()

This method is similar to `env.AI.toMarkdown` except that it is exposed through a new handle. It takes the same arguments and returns the same values.

### async env.AI.toMarkdown().supported()

Returns a list of file formats that are currently supported for markdown conversion. See [Supported formats](#supported-formats) for the full list of file formats that can be converted into Markdown.

#### Return values

* `results`: SupportedFormat\[]- An array of all formats supported for markdown conversion.

#### `SupportedFormat` definition

* `extension` string

  * Extension of files in this format.

* `mimeType` string

  * The [mime type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/MIME_types/Common_types) of files of this format

## Supported formats

This is the list of support formats. We are constantly adding new formats and updating this table.

| Format | File extensions | Mime Types |

1 Image conversion uses two Workers AI models for object detection and summarization. See [Workers AI pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/markdown-conversion/#pricing) for more details.

## Example

### Converting files

In this example, we fetch a PDF document and an image from R2 and feed them both to `env.AI.toMarkdown`. The result is a list of converted documents. Workers AI models are used automatically to detect and summarize the image.

```typescript
import { Env } from "./env";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    // https://pub-979cb28270cc461d94bc8a169d8f389d.r2.dev/somatosensory.pdf
    const pdf = await env.R2.get("somatosensory.pdf");


    // https://pub-979cb28270cc461d94bc8a169d8f389d.r2.dev/cat.jpeg
    const cat = await env.R2.get("cat.jpeg");


    return Response.json(
      // env.AI.toMarkdown().transform(...) would return the same result
      await env.AI.toMarkdown([
        {
          name: "somatosensory.pdf",
          blob: new Blob([await pdf.arrayBuffer()], {
            type: "application/octet-stream",
          }),
        },
        {
          name: "cat.jpeg",
          blob: new Blob([await cat.arrayBuffer()], {
            type: "application/octet-stream",
          }),
        },
      ]),
    );
  },
};
```

This is the result:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "somatosensory.pdf",
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
    "format": "markdown",
    "tokens": 0,
    "data": "# somatosensory.pdf\n## Metadata\n- PDFFormatVersion=1.4\n- IsLinearized=false\n- IsAcroFormPresent=false\n- IsXFAPresent=false\n- IsCollectionPresent=false\n- IsSignaturesPresent=false\n- Producer=Prince 20150210 (www.princexml.com)\n- Title=Anatomy of the Somatosensory System\n\n## Contents\n### Page 1\nThis is a sample document to showcase..."
  },
  {
    "name": "cat.jpeg",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
    "format": "markdown",
    "tokens": 0,
    "data": "The image is a close-up photograph of Grumpy Cat, a cat with a distinctive grumpy expression and piercing blue eyes. The cat has a brown face with a white stripe down its nose, and its ears are pointed upright. Its fur is light brown and darker around the face, with a pink nose and mouth. The cat's eyes are blue and slanted downward, giving it a perpetually grumpy appearance. The background is blurred, but it appears to be a dark brown color. Overall, the image is a humorous and iconic representation of the popular internet meme character, Grumpy Cat. The cat's facial expression and posture convey a sense of displeasure or annoyance, making it a relatable and entertaining image for many people."
  }
]
```

### Getting supported file formats

```typescript
import { Env } from "./env";


export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    return Response.json(
      await env.AI.toMarkdown().supported(),
    );
  },
};
```

results in

```json
[
  {
    "extension": ".pdf",
    "mimeType": "application/pdf",
  },
  {
    "extension": ".jpeg",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg",
  },
  ...
]
```

## REST API

In addition to the Workers AI [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/), you can use the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/):

### Conversion

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/tomarkdown \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
  -F "files=@cat.jpeg" \
  -F "files=@somatosensory.pdf"
```

### Supported formats

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/tomarkdown/supported \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
```

## Pricing

`toMarkdown` is free for most format conversions. In some cases, like image conversion, it can use Workers AI models for object detection and summarization, which may incur additional costs if it exceeds the Workers AI free allocation limits. See the [pricing page](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/platform/pricing/) for more details.

Part of getting good results from text generation models is asking questions correctly. LLMs are usually trained with specific predefined templates, which should then be used with the model's tokenizer for better results when doing inference tasks.

There are two ways to prompt text generation models with Workers AI:

Important

We recommend using unscoped prompts for inference with LoRA.

### Scoped Prompts

This is the **recommended** method. With scoped prompts, Workers AI takes the burden of knowing and using different chat templates for different models and provides a unified interface to developers when building prompts and creating text generation tasks.

Scoped prompts are a list of messages. Each message defines two keys: the role and the content.

Typically, the role can be one of three options:

* **system** - System messages define the AI's personality. You can use them to set rules and how you expect the AI to behave.
* **user** - User messages are where you actually query the AI by providing a question or a conversation.
* **assistant** - Assistant messages hint to the AI about the desired output format. Not all models support this role.

OpenAI has a [good explanation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation#messages-and-roles) of how they use these roles with their GPT models. Even though chat templates are flexible, other text generation models tend to follow the same conventions.

Here's an input example of a scoped prompt using system and user roles:

```js
{
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "you are a very funny comedian and you like emojis" },
    { role: "user", content: "tell me a joke about cloudflare" },
  ],
};
```

Here's a better example of a chat session using multiple iterations between the user and the assistant.

```js
{
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: "you are a professional computer science assistant" },
    { role: "user", content: "what is WASM?" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "WASM (WebAssembly) is a binary instruction format that is designed to be a platform-agnostic" },
    { role: "user", content: "does Python compile to WASM?" },
    { role: "assistant", content: "No, Python does not directly compile to WebAssembly" },
    { role: "user", content: "what about Rust?" },
  ],
};
```

Note that different LLMs are trained with different templates for different use cases. While Workers AI tries its best to abstract the specifics of each LLM template from the developer through a unified API, you should always refer to the model documentation for details (we provide links in the table above.) For example, instruct models like Codellama are fine-tuned to respond to a user-provided instruction, while chat models expect fragments of dialogs as input.

### Unscoped Prompts

You can use unscoped prompts to send a single question to the model without worrying about providing any context. Workers AI will automatically convert your `prompt` input to a reasonable default scoped prompt internally so that you get the best possible prediction.

```js
{
  prompt: "tell me a joke about cloudflare";
}
```

You can also use unscoped prompts to construct the model chat template manually. In this case, you can use the raw parameter. Here's an input example of a [Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/models/#chat-template) chat template prompt:

```js
{
  prompt: "<s>[INST]comedian[/INST]</s>
[INST]tell me a joke about cloudflare[/INST]",
  raw: true
};
```

title: Vercel AI SDK · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Workers AI can be used with the Vercel AI SDK for JavaScript and
  TypeScript codebases.

source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/ai-sdk/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/ai-sdk/index.md
---

Workers AI can be used with the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/) for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.

## Setup

Install the [`workers-ai-provider` provider](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/community-providers/cloudflare-workers-ai):

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i workers-ai-provider
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add workers-ai-provider
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add workers-ai-provider
  ```

Then, add an AI binding in your Workers project Wrangler file:

```toml
[ai]
binding = "AI"
```

## Models

The AI SDK can be configured to work with [any AI model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/).

```js
import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";


const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });


// Choose any model: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/
const model = workersai("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {});
```

## Generate Text

Once you have selected your model, you can generate text from a given prompt.

```js
import { createWorkersAI } from 'workers-ai-provider';
import { generateText } from 'ai';


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


export default {
  async fetch(_: Request, env: Env) {
    const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });
    const result = await generateText({
      model: workersai('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8'),
      prompt: 'Write a 50-word essay about hello world.',
    });


    return new Response(result.text);
  },
};
```

## Stream Text

For longer responses, consider streaming responses to provide as the generation completes.

```js
import { createWorkersAI } from 'workers-ai-provider';
import { streamText } from 'ai';


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


export default {
  async fetch(_: Request, env: Env) {
    const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });
    const result = streamText({
      model: workersai('@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8'),
      prompt: 'Write a 50-word essay about hello world.',
    });


    return result.toTextStreamResponse({
      headers: {
        // add these headers to ensure that the
        // response is chunked and streamed
        'Content-Type': 'text/x-unknown',
        'content-encoding': 'identity',
        'transfer-encoding': 'chunked',
      },
    });
  },
};
```

## Generate Structured Objects

You can provide a Zod schema to generate a structured JSON response.

```js
import { createWorkersAI } from 'workers-ai-provider';
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


export default {
  async fetch(_: Request, env: Env) {
    const workersai = createWorkersAI({ binding: env.AI });
    const result = await generateObject({
      model: workersai('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct'),
      prompt: 'Generate a Lasagna recipe',
      schema: z.object({
        recipe: z.object({
          ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
          description: z.string(),
        }),
      }),
    });


    return Response.json(result.object);
  },
};
```

## Workers

[Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create new applications or augment existing ones.

To use Workers AI with Workers, you must create a Workers AI [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/). Bindings allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. You create bindings on the Cloudflare dashboard or by updating your [Wrangler file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI" # i.e. available in your Worker on env.AI
  ```

## Pages Functions

[Pages Functions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/) allow you to build full-stack applications with Cloudflare Pages by executing code on the Cloudflare network. Functions are Workers under the hood.

To configure a Workers AI binding in your Pages Function, you must use the Cloudflare dashboard. Refer to [Workers AI bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai) for instructions.

## Methods

### async env.AI.run()

`async env.AI.run()` runs a model. Takes a model as the first parameter, and an object as the second parameter.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'"
});
```

**Parameters**

* `model` string required

  * The model to run.

  **Supported options**

  * `stream` boolean optional
    * Returns a stream of results as they are available.

```javascript
const answer = await env.AI.run('@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct', {
    prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase 'Hello, World'",
    stream: true
});


return new Response(answer, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" }
});
```

---

Use Workers AI with [Chat UI](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#text-embedding-models), an open-source chat interface offered by Hugging Face.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following:

* A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
* Your [Account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/account/find-account-and-zone-ids/)
* An [API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/#1-get-api-token-and-account-id) for Workers AI

## Setup

First, decide how to reference your Account ID and API token (either directly in your `.env.local` using the `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` variables or in the endpoint configuration).

Then, follow the rest of the setup instructions in the [Chat UI GitHub repository](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui?tab=readme-ov-file#text-embedding-models).

When setting up your models, specify the `cloudflare` endpoint.

```json
{
  "name" : "nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b",
  "tokenizer": "nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b",
  "parameters": {
    "stop": ["<|im_end|>"]
  },
  "endpoints" : [
    {
      "type": "cloudflare",
      // optionally specify these if not included in .env.local
      "accountId": "your-account-id",
      "apiToken": "your-api-token"
      //
    }
  ]
}
```

## Supported models

This template works with any [text generation models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) that begin with the `@hf` parameter.

Workers AI supports OpenAI compatible endpoints for [text generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) (`/v1/chat/completions`) and [text embedding models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) (`/v1/embeddings`). This allows you to use the same code as you would for your OpenAI commands, but swap in Workers AI easily.



## Usage

### Workers AI

Normally, Workers AI requires you to specify the model name in the cURL endpoint or within the `env.AI.run` function.

With OpenAI compatible endpoints,you can leverage the [openai-node sdk](https://github.com/openai/openai-node) to make calls to Workers AI. This allows you to use Workers AI by simply changing the base URL and the model name.

```js
import OpenAI from "openai";


const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: env.CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY,
  baseURL: `https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/${env.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1`,
});


// Use chat completions
const chatCompletion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Make some robot noises" }],
  model: "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
});


// Use responses
const response = await openai.responses.create({
  model: "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
  input: "Talk to me about open source",
});


const embeddings = await openai.embeddings.create({
  model: "@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
  input: "I love matcha",
});
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/v1/chat/completions \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer {api_token}" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '
    {
      "model": "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct",
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "how to build a wooden spoon in 3 short steps? give as short as answer as possible"
        }
      ]
    }
'
```

### AI Gateway

These endpoints are also compatible with [AI Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/usage/providers/workersai/#openai-compatible-endpoints).

Follow this guide to create a Workers AI application using the Cloudflare dashboard.

## Prerequisites

Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.

## Setup

To create a Workers AI application:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. Select **Create application**.

3. Under **Select a template**, select **LLM Chat App**.

4. Select **Deploy**.

5. Name your Worker, then select **Create and deploy**.

6. Preview your Worker at its provided [`workers.dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) subdomain.

## Development

### Dashboard

Editing in the dashboard is helpful for simpler use cases.

Once you have created your Worker script, you can edit and deploy your Worker using the Cloudflare dashboard:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers & Pages** page.

   [Go to **Workers & Pages**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages)

2. Select your application.

3. Select **Edit Code**.

![Edit code directly within the Cloudflare dashboard](https://developers.cloudflare.com/_astro/workers-edit-code.CKxxvQSe_Z2kkiqb.webp)

### Wrangler CLI

To develop more advanced applications or [implement tests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/), start working in the Wrangler CLI.

1. Install [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

1. Run the following command, replacing the value of `[<DIRECTORY>]` which the location you want to put your Worker Script.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest [<DIRECTORY>] --type=pre-existing
  ```

After you run this command - and work through the prompts - your local changes will not automatically sync with dashboard. So, once you download your script, continue using the CLI.

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first Workers AI project. You will use the Workers AI REST API to experiment with a large language model (LLM).

## Prerequisites

Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages) if you have not already.

## 1. Get API token and Account ID

You need your API token and Account ID to use the REST API.

To get these values:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Workers AI** page.

   [Go to **Workers AI**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/workers-ai)

2. Select **Use REST API**.

3. Get your API token:

   1. Select **Create a Workers AI API Token**.
   2. Review the prefilled information.
   3. Select **Create API Token**.
   4. Select **Copy API Token**.
   5. Save that value for future use.

4. For **Get Account ID**, copy the value for **Account ID**. Save that value for future use.

Note

If you choose to [create an API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/) instead of using the template, that token will need permissions for both `Workers AI - Read` and `Workers AI - Edit`.

## 2. Run a model via API

After creating your API token, authenticate and make requests to the API using your API token in the request.

You will use the [Execute AI model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/ai/methods/run/) endpoint to run the [`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/) model:

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
  -d '{ "prompt": "Where did the phrase Hello World come from" }'
```

Replace the values for `{ACCOUNT_ID}` and `{API_token}`.

The API response will look like the following:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "response": "Hello, World first appeared in 1974 at Bell Labs when Brian Kernighan included it in the C programming language example. It became widely used as a basic test program due to simplicity and clarity. It represents an inviting greeting from a program to the world."
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

This example execution uses the `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct` model, but you can use any of the models in the [Workers AI models catalog](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/). If using another model, you will need to replace `{model}` with your desired model name.

By completing this guide, you have created a Cloudflare account (if you did not have one already) and an API token that grants Workers AI read permissions to your account. You executed the [`@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/) model using a cURL command from the terminal and received an answer to your prompt in a JSON response.

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first Workers AI project. You will use [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/), a Workers AI binding, and a large language model (LLM) to deploy your first AI-powered application on the Cloudflare global network.

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

## 1. Create a Worker project

You will create a new Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` CLI (C3). [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

Create a new project named `hello-ai` by running:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- hello-ai
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare hello-ai
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest hello-ai
  ```

Running `npm create cloudflare@latest` will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare), and lead you through setup. C3 will also install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

This will create a new `hello-ai` directory. Your new `hello-ai` directory will include:

* A `"Hello World"` [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) at `src/index.ts`.
* A [`wrangler.jsonc`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file.

Go to your application directory:

```sh
cd hello-ai
```

## 2. Connect your Worker to Workers AI

You must create an AI binding for your Worker to connect to Workers AI. [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your Wrangler file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

Your binding is [available in your Worker code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#bindings-in-es-modules-format) on [`env.AI`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

You can also bind Workers AI to a Pages Function. For more information, refer to [Functions Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/functions/bindings/#workers-ai).

## 3. Run an inference task in your Worker

You are now ready to run an inference task in your Worker. In this case, you will use an LLM, [`llama-3.1-8b-instruct`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/), to answer a question.

Update the `index.ts` file in your `hello-ai` application directory with the following code:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  export default {
    async fetch(request, env) {
      const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
        prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      });


      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  export interface Env {
    // If you set another name in the Wrangler config file as the value for 'binding',
    // replace "AI" with the variable name you defined.
    AI: Ai;
  }


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
      const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
        prompt: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      });


      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

Up to this point, you have created an AI binding for your Worker and configured your Worker to be able to execute the Llama 3.1 model. You can now test your project locally before you deploy globally.

## 4. Develop locally with Wrangler

While in your project directory, test Workers AI locally by running [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev):

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

Workers AI local development usage charges

Using Workers AI always accesses your Cloudflare account in order to run AI models and will incur usage charges even in local development.

You will be prompted to log in after you run the `wrangler dev`. When you run `npx wrangler dev`, Wrangler will give you a URL (most likely `localhost:8787`) to review your Worker. After you go to the URL Wrangler provides, a message will render that resembles the following example:

```json
{
  "response": "Ah, a most excellent question, my dear human friend! *adjusts glasses*\n\nThe origin of the phrase \"Hello, World\" is a fascinating tale that spans several decades and multiple disciplines. It all began in the early days of computer programming, when a young man named Brian Kernighan was tasked with writing a simple program to demonstrate the basics of a new programming language called C.\nKernighan, a renowned computer scientist and author, was working at Bell Labs in the late 1970s when he created the program. He wanted to showcase the language's simplicity and versatility, so he wrote a basic \"Hello, World!\" program that printed the familiar greeting to the console.\nThe program was included in Kernighan and Ritchie's influential book \"The C Programming Language,\" published in 1978. The book became a standard reference for C programmers, and the \"Hello, World!\" program became a sort of \"Hello, World!\" for the programming community.\nOver time, the phrase \"Hello, World!\" became a shorthand for any simple program that demonstrated the basics"
}
```

## 5. Deploy your AI Worker

Before deploying your AI Worker globally, log in with your Cloudflare account by running:

```sh
npx wrangler login
```

You will be directed to a web page asking you to log in to the Cloudflare dashboard. After you have logged in, you will be asked if Wrangler can make changes to your Cloudflare account. Scroll down and select **Allow** to continue.

Finally, deploy your Worker to make your project accessible on the Internet. To deploy your Worker, run:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

```sh
https://hello-ai.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev
```

Your Worker will be deployed to your custom [`workers.dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/workers-dev/) subdomain. You can now visit the URL to run your AI Worker.

By finishing this tutorial, you have created a Worker, connected it to Workers AI through an AI binding, and ran an inference task from the Llama 3 model.

title: Pricing · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Workers AI is included in both the Free and Paid Workers plans and
  is priced at $0.011 per 1,000 Neurons.

Note

Workers AI has updated pricing to be more granular, with per-model unit-based pricing presented, but still billing in neurons in the back end.

Workers AI is included in both the [Free and Paid Workers plans](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/) and is priced at **$0.011 per 1,000 Neurons**.

Our free allocation allows anyone to use a total of **10,000 Neurons per day at no charge**. To use more than 10,000 Neurons per day, you need to sign up for the [Workers Paid plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers). On Workers Paid, you will be charged at $0.011 / 1,000 Neurons for any usage above the free allocation of 10,000 Neurons per day.

You can monitor your Neuron usage in the [Cloudflare Workers AI dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/workers-ai).

All limits reset daily at 00:00 UTC. If you exceed any one of the above limits, further operations will fail with an error.

| | Free allocation | Pricing |
| - | - | - |
| Workers Free | 10,000 Neurons per day | N/A - Upgrade to Workers Paid |
| Workers Paid | 10,000 Neurons per day | $0.011 / 1,000 Neurons |

## What are Neurons?

Neurons are our way of measuring AI outputs across different models, representing the GPU compute needed to perform your request. Our serverless model allows you to pay only for what you use without having to worry about renting, managing, or scaling GPUs.

Note

The Price in Tokens column is equivalent to the Price in Neurons column - the different units are displayed so you can easily compare and understand pricing.

OpenAI compatible endpoints

Workers AI also supports OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `text` one of required

    * `0` string min 1

      The text to embed

    * `1` array

      Batch of text values to embed

      * `items` string min 1

        The text to embed

  * `pooling` string default mean

    The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

* `1` object

  * `requests` array required

    Batch of the embeddings requests to run using async-queue

    * `items` object

      * `text` one of required

        * `0` string min 1

          The text to embed

        * `1` array

          Batch of text values to embed

          * `items` string min 1

            The text to embed

      * `pooling` string default mean

        The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `shape` array

    * `items` number

  * `data` array

    Embeddings of the requested text values

    * `items` array

      Floating point embedding representation shaped by the embedding model

      * `items` number

  * `pooling` string

    The pooling method used in the embedding process.

* `1` object

  * `request_id` string

    The async request id that can be used to obtain the results.

## Usage

Workers - TypeScript

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];


    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests




ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)


print(response.json())
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-large-en-v1.5  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "text": ["This is a story about an orange cloud", "This is a story about a llama", "This is a story about a hugging emoji"] }'
```

  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];


    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/baai/bge-m3",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests




ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-m3",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)


print(response.json())
```

  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];


    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests




ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)


print(response.json())
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-small-en-v1.5  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "text": ["This is a story about an orange cloud", "This is a story about a llama", "This is a story about a hugging emoji"] }'
```

OpenAI compatible endpoints

Workers AI also supports OpenAI compatible API endpoints for `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/embeddings`. For more details, refer to [Configurations ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/open-ai-compatibility/).

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `text` one of required

    * `0` string min 1

      The text to embed

    * `1` array

      Batch of text values to embed

      * `items` string min 1

        The text to embed

  * `pooling` string default mean

    The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

* `1` object

  * `requests` array required

    Batch of the embeddings requests to run using async-queue

    * `items` object

      * `text` one of required

        * `0` string min 1

          The text to embed

        * `1` array

          Batch of text values to embed

          * `items` string min 1

            The text to embed

      * `pooling` string default mean

        The pooling method used in the embedding process. \`cls\` pooling will generate more accurate embeddings on larger inputs - however, embeddings created with cls pooling are not compatible with embeddings generated with mean pooling. The default pooling method is \`mean\` in order for this to not be a breaking change, but we highly suggest using the new \`cls\` pooling for better accuracy.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `shape` array

    * `items` number

  * `data` array

    Embeddings of the requested text values

    * `items` array

      Floating point embedding representation shaped by the embedding model

      * `items` number

  * `pooling` string

    The pooling method used in the embedding process.

* `1` object

  * `request_id` string

    The async request id that can be used to obtain the results.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `messages` array required

    An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

    * `items` object

      * `role` string required

        The role of the message sender (e.g., 'user', 'assistant', 'system', 'tool').

                  A description of the expected parameter.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `response` string required

    The generated text response from the model

  * `usage` object

    Usage statistics for the inference request

    * `prompt_tokens` number 0

      Total number of tokens in input

    * `completion_tokens` number 0

      Total number of tokens in output

    * `total_tokens` number 0

      Total number of input and output tokens

  * `tool_calls` array

    An array of tool calls requests made during the response generation

    * `items` object

      * `arguments` object

        The arguments passed to be passed to the tool call request

      * `name` string

        The name of the tool to be called

* `1` string

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

Automatic Speech Recognition • Deepgram

@cf/deepgram/flux

Flux is the first conversational speech recognition model built specifically for voice agents.

| Model Info | |
| - | - |
| Terms and License | [link](https://deepgram.com/terms) |
| Partner | Yes |
| Real-time | Yes |
| Unit Pricing | $0.0077 per audio minute (websocket) |

## Usage

Step 1: Create a Worker that establishes a WebSocket connection

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    const resp = await env.AI.run("@cf/deepgram/flux", {
      encoding: "linear16",
      sample_rate: "16000"
    }, {
      websocket: true
    });
    return resp;
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Step 2: Deploy your Worker

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Step 3: Write a client script to connect to your Worker and send audio

```js
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://<your-worker-url.com>');


ws.onopen = () => {
  console.log('Connected to WebSocket');


  // Generate and send random audio bytes
  // You can replace this part with a function
  // that reads from your mic or other audio source
  const audioData = generateRandomAudio();
  ws.send(audioData);
  console.log('Audio data sent');
};


ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  // Transcription will be received here
  // Add your custom logic to parse the data
  console.log('Received:', event.data);
};


ws.onerror = (error) => {
  console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
};


ws.onclose = () => {
  console.log('WebSocket closed');
};


// Generate random audio data (1 second of noise at 44.1kHz, mono)
function generateRandomAudio() {
  const sampleRate = 44100;
  const duration = 1;
  const numSamples = sampleRate * duration;
  const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(numSamples * 2);
  const view = new Int16Array(buffer);


  for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    view[i] = Math.floor(Math.random() * 65536 - 32768);
  }


  return buffer;
}
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `encoding` string required

  Encoding of the audio stream. Currently only supports raw signed little-endian 16-bit PCM.

* `sample_rate` string required

  Sample rate of the audio stream in Hz.

* `eager_eot_threshold` string

  End-of-turn confidence required to fire an eager end-of-turn event. When set, enables EagerEndOfTurn and TurnResumed events. Valid Values 0.3 - 0.9.

* `eot_threshold` string default 0.7

  End-of-turn confidence required to finish a turn. Valid Values 0.5 - 0.9.

* `eot_timeout_ms` string default 5000

  A turn will be finished when this much time has passed after speech, regardless of EOT confidence.

* `keyterm` string

  Keyterm prompting can improve recognition of specialized terminology. Pass multiple keyterm query parameters to boost multiple keyterms.

* `mip_opt_out` string default false

  Opts out requests from the Deepgram Model Improvement Program. Refer to Deepgram Docs for pricing impacts before setting this to true. https\://dpgr.am/deepgram-mip

* `tag` string

  Label your requests for the purpose of identification during usage reporting

### Output

* `request_id` string

  The unique identifier of the request (uuid)

* `sequence_id` integer min 0

  Starts at 0 and increments for each message the server sends to the client.

* `event` string

  The type of event being reported.

* `turn_index` integer min 0

  The index of the current turn

* `audio_window_start` number

  Start time in seconds of the audio range that was transcribed

* `audio_window_end` number

  End time in seconds of the audio range that was transcribed

* `transcript` string

  Text that was said over the course of the current turn

* `words` array

  The words in the transcript

  * `items` object

    * `word` string required

      The individual punctuated, properly-cased word from the transcript

    * `confidence` number required

      Confidence that this word was transcribed correctly

* `end_of_turn_confidence` number

  Confidence that no more speech is coming in this turn

export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/google/gemma-2b-it-lora", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });

export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@hf/google/gemma-7b-it", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Worker

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];
    const response = await env.AI.run("@hf/google/gemma-7b-it", { messages });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests


ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


prompt = "Tell me all about PEP-8"
response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@hf/google/gemma-7b-it",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
    json={
      "messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly assistant"},
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
      ]
    }
)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/google/gemma-7b-it-lora", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

OpenAI’s open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases – gpt-oss-120b is for production, general purpose, high reasoning use-cases.

| Model Info | |
| - | - |
| Context Window[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/glossary/) | 128,000 tokens |
| Unit Pricing | $0.35 per M input tokens, $0.75 per M output tokens |

## Usage

Worker

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const response = await env.AI.run('@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b', {
      instructions: 'You are a concise assistant.',
      input: 'What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World?',
    });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests


ACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID")
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


prompt = "Tell me all about PEP-8"
response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1/responses",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
    json={
      "model": "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
      "input": "Tell me all about PEP-8"
    }
)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/v1/responses   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN"   -d '{
    "model": "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b",
    "input": "What are the benefits of open-source models?"
  }'
```

OpenAI’s open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases – gpt-oss-20b is for lower latency, and local or specialized use-cases.

| Model Info | |
| - | - |
| Context Window[](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/glossary/) | 128,000 tokens |
| Unit Pricing | $0.20 per M input tokens, $0.30 per M output tokens |

## Usage

Worker

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const response = await env.AI.run('@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b', {
      instructions: 'You are a concise assistant.',
      input: 'What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World?',
    });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests


ACCOUNT_ID = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID")
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


prompt = "Tell me all about PEP-8"
response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/v1/responses",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
    json={
      "model": "@cf/openai/gpt-oss-20b",
      "input": "Tell me all about PEP-8"
    }
)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/v1/responses   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN"   -d '{

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Worker

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];
    const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-2-7b-chat-int8", { messages });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },

export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];
    const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct", { messages });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `frequency_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `image` one of

    * `0` array

      An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

      * `items` number

        A value between 0 and 255

    * `1` string

      Binary string representing the image contents.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `presence_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

  * `prompt` string required min 1 max 131072

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `frequency_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `image` one of

    * `0` array

      An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

      * `items` number

        A value between 0 and 255

    * `1` string

      Binary string representing the image contents.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `presence_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

  * `prompt` string required min 1 max 131072

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

        * `function` object required

          Details of the function tool.

          * `description` string required

            A brief description of what the function does.

          * `name` string required

            The name of the function.

          * `parameters` object required

            Schema defining the parameters accepted by the function.

            * `properties` object required

              Definitions of each parameter.

              * `additionalProperties` object

                * `description` string required

                  A description of the expected parameter.

                * `type` string required

                  The data type of the parameter.

            * `required` array

              List of required parameter names.

              * `items` string

            * `type` string required

              The type of the parameters object (usually 'object').

        * `type` string required

          Specifies the type of tool (e.g., 'function').

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `top_p` number min 0 max 2

    Controls the creativity of the AI's responses by adjusting how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `response` string

    The generated text response from the model

  * `tool_calls` array

    An array of tool calls requests made during the response generation

    * `items` object

      * `arguments` object

        The arguments passed to be passed to the tool call request

      * `name` string

        The name of the tool to be called

* `1` string

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `guided_json` object

    JSON schema that should be fulfilled for the response.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const messages = [
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: 'I wanna bully someone online',
      },
      {
        role: 'assistant',
        content: 'That sounds interesting, how can I help?',
      },
    ];
    const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-guard-3-8b", { messages });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-guard-3-8b",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
    json={
      "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "I want to bully somebody online"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting. Let me know how I can be of assistance?"},
      ]
    }
)
result = response.json()
print(result)
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-guard-3-8b \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{ "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "I want to bully someone online" }, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Interesting. How can I assist you?"}]}'

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

# llava-1.5-7b-hf Beta

Image-to-Text • llava-hf

@cf/llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf

LLaVA is an open-source chatbot trained by fine-tuning LLaMA/Vicuna on GPT-generated multimodal instruction-following data. It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture.

| Model Info | |
| - | - |
| Beta | Yes |

## Usage

Workers - TypeScript

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}




export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const res = await fetch("https://cataas.com/cat");
    const blob = await res.arrayBuffer();
    const input = {
      image: [...new Uint8Array(blob)],
      prompt: "Generate a caption for this image",
      max_tokens: 512,
    };
    const response = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf",
      input
      );
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` string

  Binary string representing the image contents.

* `1` object

  * `image` one of required

    * `0` array

      An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

      * `items` number

        A value between 0 and 255

    * `1` string

      Binary string representing the image contents.

  * `temperature` number

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `prompt` string

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `top_p` number

    Controls the creativity of the AI's responses by adjusting how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` number

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` number

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 512

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

### Output

* `description` string

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `messages` array required

    An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

    * `items` object

                  The data type of the parameter.

                * `description` string required

                  A description of the expected parameter.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

### Output

* `0` object

  * `response` string required

    The generated text response from the model

  * `usage` object

    Usage statistics for the inference request

    * `prompt_tokens` number 0

      Total number of tokens in input

    * `completion_tokens` number 0

      Total number of tokens in output

    * `total_tokens` number 0

      Total number of input and output tokens

  * `tool_calls` array

    An array of tool calls requests made during the response generation

    * `items` object

      * `arguments` object

        The arguments passed to be passed to the tool call request

      * `name` string

        The name of the tool to be called

* `1` string

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@hf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

### Output

    * `completion_tokens` number 0

      Total number of tokens in output

    * `total_tokens` number 0

      Total number of input and output tokens

  * `tool_calls` array

    An array of tool calls requests made during the response generation

    * `items` object

      * `arguments` object

        The arguments passed to be passed to the tool call request

      * `name` string

        The name of the tool to be called

* `1` string

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `messages` array required

    An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

## Usage

Worker

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx): Promise<Response> {
    const URL = "https://URL_TO_MP3_FILE/audio.mp3";
    const mp3 = await fetch(URL);




    const resp = await env.AI.run("@cf/deepgram/nova-3", {
      "audio": {
        body: mp3.body,
        contentType: "audio/mpeg"
      },
      "detect_language": true
    }, {
      returnRawResponse: true
    });
    return resp;
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

curl

```sh
curl --request POST   --url 'https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/deepgram/nova-3?detect_language=true'   --header 'Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}'   --header 'Content-Type: audio/mpeg'   --data-binary "@/path/to/your-mp3-file.mp3"
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `audio` object required

  * `body` object required

  * `contentType` string required

* `custom_topic_mode` string

  Sets how the model will interpret strings submitted to the custom\_topic param. When strict, the model will only return topics submitted using the custom\_topic param. When extended, the model will return its own detected topics in addition to those submitted using the custom\_topic param.

* `custom_topic` string

  Custom topics you want the model to detect within your input audio or text if present Submit up to 100

* `custom_intent_mode` string

  Sets how the model will interpret intents submitted to the custom\_intent param. When strict, the model will only return intents submitted using the custom\_intent param. When extended, the model will return its own detected intents in addition those submitted using the custom\_intents param

* `custom_intent` string

  Custom intents you want the model to detect within your input audio if present

* `detect_entities` boolean

  Identifies and extracts key entities from content in submitted audio

* `detect_language` boolean

  Identifies the dominant language spoken in submitted audio

* `diarize` boolean

  Recognize speaker changes. Each word in the transcript will be assigned a speaker number starting at 0

* `dictation` boolean

  Identify and extract key entities from content in submitted audio

* `encoding` string

  Specify the expected encoding of your submitted audio

* `extra` string

  Arbitrary key-value pairs that are attached to the API response for usage in downstream processing

* `filler_words` boolean

  Filler Words can help transcribe interruptions in your audio, like 'uh' and 'um'

* `keyterm` string

  Key term prompting can boost or suppress specialized terminology and brands.

* `keywords` string

  Keywords can boost or suppress specialized terminology and brands.

* `language` string

  The BCP-47 language tag that hints at the primary spoken language. Depending on the Model and API endpoint you choose only certain languages are available.

* `measurements` boolean

  Spoken measurements will be converted to their corresponding abbreviations.

* `mip_opt_out` boolean

  Opts out requests from the Deepgram Model Improvement Program. Refer to our Docs for pricing impacts before setting this to true. https\://dpgr.am/deepgram-mip.

* `mode` string

  Mode of operation for the model representing broad area of topic that will be talked about in the supplied audio

* `multichannel` boolean

  Transcribe each audio channel independently.

* `numerals` boolean

  Numerals converts numbers from written format to numerical format.

* `paragraphs` boolean

  Splits audio into paragraphs to improve transcript readability.

* `profanity_filter` boolean

  Profanity Filter looks for recognized profanity and converts it to the nearest recognized non-profane word or removes it from the transcript completely.

* `punctuate` boolean

  Add punctuation and capitalization to the transcript.

* `redact` string

  Redaction removes sensitive information from your transcripts.

* `replace` string

  Search for terms or phrases in submitted audio and replaces them.

  Seconds to wait before detecting a pause between words in submitted audio.

* `channels` number

  The number of channels in the submitted audio

* `interim_results` boolean

  Specifies whether the streaming endpoint should provide ongoing transcription updates as more audio is received. When set to true, the endpoint sends continuous updates, meaning transcription results may evolve over time. Note: Supported only for webosockets.

* `endpointing` string

  Indicates how long model will wait to detect whether a speaker has finished speaking or pauses for a significant period of time. When set to a value, the streaming endpoint immediately finalizes the transcription for the processed time range and returns the transcript with a speech\_final parameter set to true. Can also be set to false to disable endpointing

* `vad_events` boolean

  Indicates that speech has started. You'll begin receiving Speech Started messages upon speech starting. Note: Supported only for webosockets.

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/openchat/openchat-3.5-0106", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `messages` array required

    An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

    * `items` object

      * `role` string required

        The role of the message sender (e.g., 'user', 'assistant', 'system', 'tool').

      * `content` string required

        The content of the message as a string.

  * `functions` array

    * `items` object

      * `name` string required

      * `code` string required

  * `tools` array

    A list of tools available for the assistant to use.

    * `items` one of

      * `0` object

        * `name` string required

          The name of the tool. More descriptive the better.

        * `description` string required

          A brief description of what the tool does.

export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a friendly assistant" },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/microsoft/phi-2", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

## Usage

Workers - TypeScript

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    const inputs = {
      prompt: "cyberpunk cat",
    };


    const response = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/leonardo/phoenix-1.0",
      inputs
    );


    return new Response(response, {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "image/jpg",
      },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/leonardo/phoenix-1.0  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "prompt": "cyberpunk cat" }'
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `prompt` string required min 1

  A text description of the image you want to generate.

* `guidance` number default 2 min 2 max 10

  Controls how closely the generated image should adhere to the prompt; higher values make the image more aligned with the prompt

* `seed` integer min 0

  Random seed for reproducibility of the image generation

* `height` integer default 1024 min 0 max 2048

  The height of the generated image in pixels

* `width` integer default 1024 min 0 max 2048

  The width of the generated image in pixels

* `num_steps` integer default 25 min 1 max 50

  The number of diffusion steps; higher values can improve quality but take longer

* `negative_prompt` string min 1

  Specify what to exclude from the generated images

### Output

The binding returns a `ReadableStream` with the image in JPEG or PNG format (check the model's output schema).

## API Schemas

The following schemas are based on JSON Schema

* Input

  ```json
  {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
          "prompt": {

      {
        role: "user",
        content: "What is the origin of the phrase Hello, World",
      },
    ];


    const stream = await env.AI.run("@cf/qwen/qwen1.5-7b-chat-awq", {
      messages,
      stream: true,
    });


    return new Response(stream, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/event-stream" },
    });
  },

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `messages` array required

    An array of message objects representing the conversation history.

    * `items` object

      * `role` string required

        The role of the message sender (e.g., 'user', 'assistant', 'system', 'tool').

      * `content` string required

        The content of the message as a string.

  * `functions` array

    * `items` object

      * `name` string required

      * `code` string required

  * `tools` array

    A list of tools available for the assistant to use.

    * `items` one of

      * `0` object

        * `name` string required

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

                    List of required parameter names.

                    * `items` string

                  * `properties` object required

                    Definitions of each parameter.

                    * `additionalProperties` object

                      * `type` string required

                        The data type of the parameter.

                      * `description` string required

                        A description of the expected parameter.

        * `response_format` object

          * `type` string

          * `json_schema`

        * `raw` boolean

          If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

        * `stream` boolean

          If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

        * `max_tokens` integer default 256

          The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

        * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

          Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

        * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

          Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

        * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

          Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

          Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

        * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

          Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

        * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

          Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

        * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

          Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Can be a string or array of strings]
    const stories = [
      "This is a story about an orange cloud",
      "This is a story about a llama",
      "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
    ];


    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/qwen/qwen3-embedding-0.6b",
      {
        text: stories,
      }
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

Python

```py
import os
import requests




ACCOUNT_ID = "your-account-id"
AUTH_TOKEN = os.environ.get("CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN")


stories = [
  'This is a story about an orange cloud',
  'This is a story about a llama',
  'This is a story about a hugging emoji'
]


response = requests.post(
  f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/qwen/qwen3-embedding-0.6b",
  headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}"},
  json={"text": stories}
)


print(response.json())
```

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {


    // Picture of a dog
    const exampleInputImage = await fetch(
      "https://pub-1fb693cb11cc46b2b2f656f51e015a2c.r2.dev/dog.png"
    );


    const inputs = {
      prompt: "Change to a lion",
      image: [...new Uint8Array(await exampleInputImage.arrayBuffer())],
    };


    const response = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5-img2img",
      inputs
    );


    return new Response(response, {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "image/png",
      },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

curl

```sh
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5-img2img  \
  -X POST  \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"  \
  -d '{ "prompt": "cyberpunk cat" }'
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `prompt` string required min 1

  A text description of the image you want to generate

* `negative_prompt` string

  Text describing elements to avoid in the generated image

* `height` integer min 256 max 2048

  The height of the generated image in pixels

* `width` integer min 256 max 2048

  The width of the generated image in pixels

* `image` array

  For use with img2img tasks. An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

  * `items` number

    A value between 0 and 255

* `image_b64` string

  For use with img2img tasks. A base64-encoded string of the input image

* `mask` array

  An array representing An array of integers that represent mask image data for inpainting constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

  * `items` number

    A value between 0 and 255

* `num_steps` integer default 20 max 20

  The number of diffusion steps; higher values can improve quality but take longer

* `strength` number default 1

  A value between 0 and 1 indicating how strongly to apply the transformation during img2img tasks; lower values make the output closer to the input image

* `guidance` number default 7.5

  Controls how closely the generated image should adhere to the prompt; higher values make the image more aligned with the prompt

* `seed` integer

  Random seed for reproducibility of the image generation

### Output

The binding returns a `ReadableStream` with the image in JPEG or PNG format (check the model's output schema).

## API Schemas

The following schemas are based on JSON Schema

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` object

  * `prompt` string required min 1

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `lora` string

    Name of the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model to fine-tune the base model.

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `stream` boolean

    If true, the response will be streamed back incrementally using SSE, Server Sent Events.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 256

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

  * `temperature` number default 0.6 min 0 max 5

    Controls the randomness of the output; higher values produce more random results.

  * `top_p` number min 0.001 max 1

    Adjusts the creativity of the AI's responses by controlling how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` integer min 1 max 50

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` integer min 1 max 9999999999

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number min 0 max 2

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number min -2 max 2

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

* `1` object

  * `response_format` object

    * `type` string

    * `json_schema`

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

Image-to-Text • unum

@cf/unum/uform-gen2-qwen-500m

UForm-Gen is a small generative vision-language model primarily designed for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering. The model was pre-trained on the internal image captioning dataset and fine-tuned on public instructions datasets: SVIT, LVIS, VQAs datasets.

| Model Info | |
| - | - |
| More information | [link](https://www.unum.cloud/) |
| Beta | Yes |

## Usage

Workers - TypeScript

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}




export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const res = await fetch("https://cataas.com/cat");
    const blob = await res.arrayBuffer();
    const input = {
      image: [...new Uint8Array(blob)],
      prompt: "Generate a caption for this image",
      max_tokens: 512,
    };
    const response = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/unum/uform-gen2-qwen-500m",
      input
      );
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `0` string

  Binary string representing the image contents.

* `1` object

  * `prompt` string

    The input text prompt for the model to generate a response.

  * `raw` boolean

    If true, a chat template is not applied and you must adhere to the specific model's expected formatting.

  * `top_p` number

    Controls the creativity of the AI's responses by adjusting how many possible words it considers. Lower values make outputs more predictable; higher values allow for more varied and creative responses.

  * `top_k` number

    Limits the AI to choose from the top 'k' most probable words. Lower values make responses more focused; higher values introduce more variety and potential surprises.

  * `seed` number

    Random seed for reproducibility of the generation.

  * `repetition_penalty` number

    Penalty for repeated tokens; higher values discourage repetition.

  * `frequency_penalty` number

    Decreases the likelihood of the model repeating the same lines verbatim.

  * `presence_penalty` number

    Increases the likelihood of the model introducing new topics.

  * `image` one of required

    * `0` array

      An array of integers that represent the image data constrained to 8-bit unsigned integer values

      * `items` number

        A value between 0 and 255

    * `1` string

      Binary string representing the image contents.

  * `max_tokens` integer default 512

    The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

### Output

* `description` string

To enable built-in Node.js APIs and polyfills, add the nodejs\_compat compatibility flag to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/). This also enables nodejs\_compat\_v2 as long as your compatibility date is 2024-09-23 or later. [Learn more about the Node.js compatibility flag and v2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag).

## Parameters

\* indicates a required field

### Input

* `audio` string required

  Base64 encoded value of the audio data.

* `task` string default transcribe

  Supported tasks are 'translate' or 'transcribe'.

* `language` string

  The language of the audio being transcribed or translated.

* `vad_filter` boolean

  Preprocess the audio with a voice activity detection model.

* `initial_prompt` string

  A text prompt to help provide context to the model on the contents of the audio.

* `prefix` string

  The prefix it appended the the beginning of the output of the transcription and can guide the transcription result.

### Output

* `transcription_info` object

  * `language` string

    The language of the audio being transcribed or translated.

  * `language_probability` number

    The confidence level or probability of the detected language being accurate, represented as a decimal between 0 and 1.

  * `duration` number

    The total duration of the original audio file, in seconds.

  * `duration_after_vad` number

    The duration of the audio after applying Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to remove silent or irrelevant sections, in seconds.

* `text` string required

  The complete transcription of the audio.

* `word_count` number

  The total number of words in the transcription.

* `segments` array

  * `items` object

    * `start` number

      The ending time of the segment within the audio, in seconds.

    * `text` string

      The transcription of the segment.

    * `temperature` number

      The temperature used in the decoding process, controlling randomness in predictions. Lower values result in more deterministic outputs.

    * `avg_logprob` number

      The average log probability of the predictions for the words in this segment, indicating overall confidence.

    * `compression_ratio` number

      The compression ratio of the input to the output, measuring how much the text was compressed during the transcription process.

    * `no_speech_prob` number

      The probability that the segment contains no speech, represented as a decimal between 0 and 1.

    * `words` array

      * `items` object

        * `word` string

          The individual word transcribed from the audio.

        * `start` number

          The starting time of the word within the audio, in seconds.

        * `end` number

          The ending time of the word within the audio, in seconds.

If you prefer to work directly with the REST API instead of a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/batch-api/workers-binding/), below are the steps on how to do it:

## 1. Sending a Batch Request

Make a POST request using the following pattern. You can pass `external_reference` as a unique ID per-prompt that will be returned in the response.

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-m3?queueRequest=true" \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --json '{
    "requests": [
        {
            "query": "This is a story about Cloudflare",
            "contexts": [
                {
                    "text": "This is a story about an orange cloud",
                    "external_reference": "story1"
                },
                {
                    "text": "This is a story about a llama",
                    "external_reference": "story2"
                },
                {
                    "text": "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
                    "external_reference": "story3"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
  }'
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "status": "queued",
    "request_id": "768f15b7-4fd6-4498-906e-ad94ffc7f8d2",
    "model": "@cf/baai/bge-m3"
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

## 2. Retrieving the Batch Response

After receiving a `request_id` from your initial POST, you can poll for or retrieve the results with another POST request:

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/baai/bge-m3?queueRequest=true" \
 --header "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --json '{
    "request_id": "<uuid>"
  }'
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "responses": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "result": {
          "response": [
            { "id": 0, "score": 0.73974609375 },
            { "id": 1, "score": 0.642578125 },
            { "id": 2, "score": 0.6220703125 }
          ]
        },
        "success": true,
        "external_reference": null
      }
    ],
    "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 12, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 12 }
  },
  "success": true,
  "errors": [],
  "messages": []
}
```

You can use Workers Bindings to interact with the Batch API.

## Send a Batch request

Send your initial batch inference request by composing a JSON payload containing an array of individual inference requests and the `queueRequest: true` property (which is what controlls queueing behavior).

Note

Ensure that the total payload is under 10 MB.

```ts
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}
export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const embeddings = await env.AI.run(
      "@cf/baai/bge-m3",
      {
        requests: [
          {
            query: "This is a story about Cloudflare",
            contexts: [
              {
                text: "This is a story about an orange cloud",
              },
              {
                text: "This is a story about a llama",
              },
              {
                text: "This is a story about a hugging emoji",
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
      { queueRequest: true },
    );


    return Response.json(embeddings);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```json
{
  "status": "queued",
  "model": "@cf/baai/bge-m3",
  "request_id": "000-000-000"
}
```

You will get a response with the following values:

* **`status`**: Indicates that your request is queued.
* **`request_id`**: A unique identifier for the batch request.
* **`model`**: The model used for the batch inference.

Of these, the `request_id` is important for when you need to [poll the batch status](#poll-batch-status).

### Poll batch status

Once your batch request is queued, use the `request_id` to poll for its status. During processing, the API returns a status `queued` or `running` indicating that the request is still in the queue or being processed.

```typescript
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const status = await env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-m3", {
      request_id: "000-000-000",
    });


    return Response.json(status);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

```json
{
  "responses": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "result": {
        "response": [
          { "id": 0, "score": 0.73974609375 },
          { "id": 1, "score": 0.642578125 },
          { "id": 2, "score": 0.6220703125 }
        ]
      },
      "success": true,
      "external_reference": null
    }
  ],
  "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 12, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 12 }
}
```

When the inference is complete, the API returns a final HTTP status code of `200` along with an array of responses. Each response object corresponds to an individual input prompt, identified by an `id` that maps to the index of the prompt in your original request.

title: Fine-tuned inference with LoRA adapters · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Upload and use LoRA adapters to get fine-tuned inference on Workers AI.

---

Workers AI supports fine-tuned inference with adapters trained with [Low-Rank Adaptation](https://blog.cloudflare.com/fine-tuned-inference-with-loras). This feature is in open beta and free during this period.

## Limitations

* We only support LoRAs for a [variety of models](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/?capabilities=LoRA) (must not be quantized)
* Adapter must be trained with rank `r <=8` as well as larger ranks if up to 32. You can check the rank of a pre-trained LoRA adapter through the adapter's `config.json` file
* LoRA adapter file must be < 300MB
* LoRA adapter files must be named `adapter_config.json` and `adapter_model.safetensors` exactly
* You can test up to 100 LoRA adapters per account

***

## Choosing compatible LoRA adapters

### Finding open-source LoRA adapters

We have started a [Hugging Face Collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/Cloudflare/workers-ai-compatible-loras-6608dd9f8d305a46e355746e) that lists a few LoRA adapters that are compatible with Workers AI. Generally, any LoRA adapter that fits our limitations above should work.

### Training your own LoRA adapters

To train your own LoRA adapter, follow the [tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/fine-tune-models-with-autotrain/).

***

## Uploading LoRA adapters

In order to run inference with LoRAs on Workers AI, you'll need to create a new fine tune on your account and upload your adapter files. You should have a `adapter_model.safetensors` file with model weights and `adapter_config.json` with your config information. *Note that we only accept adapter files in these types.*

Right now, you can't edit a fine tune's asset files after you upload it. We will support this soon, but for now you will need to create a new fine tune and upload files again if you would like to use a new LoRA.

Before you upload your LoRA adapter, you'll need to edit your `adapter_config.json` file to include `model_type` as one of `mistral`, `gemma` or `llama` like below.

```json
{
  "alpha_pattern": {},
  "auto_mapping": null,
  ...
  "target_modules": [
    "q_proj",
    "v_proj"
  ],
  "task_type": "CAUSAL_LM",
  "model_type": "mistral",
}
```

### Wrangler

You can create a finetune and upload your LoRA adapter via wrangler with the following commands:

```bash
npx wrangler ai finetune create <model_name> <finetune_name> <folder_path>
#🌀 Creating new finetune "test-lora" for model "@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora"...
#🌀 Uploading file "/Users/abcd/Downloads/adapter_config.json" to "test-lora"...
#🌀 Uploading file "/Users/abcd/Downloads/adapter_model.safetensors" to "test-lora"...
#✅ Assets uploaded, finetune "test-lora" is ready to use.


npx wrangler ai finetune list
┌──────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────┐
│ finetune_id                          │ name            │ description │
├──────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────┤
│ 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 │ test-lora       │             │
└──────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### REST API

Alternatively, you can use our REST API to create a finetune and upload your adapter files. You will need a Cloudflare API Token with `Workers AI: Edit` permissions to make calls to our REST API, which you can generate via the Cloudflare Dashboard.

#### Creating a fine-tune on your account

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `Workers AI Write`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/finetunes" \
  --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  --json '{
    "model": "SUPPORTED_MODEL_NAME",
    "name": "FINETUNE_NAME",
    "description": "OPTIONAL_DESCRIPTION"
  }'
```

#### Uploading your adapter weights and config

You have to call the upload endpoint each time you want to upload a new file, so you usually run this once for `adapter_model.safetensors` and once for `adapter_config.json`. Make sure you include the `@` before your path to files.

You can either use the finetune `name` or `id` that you used when you created the fine tune.

```bash
## Input: finetune_id, adapter_model.safetensors, then adapter_config.json
## Output: success true/false


curl -X POST https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/finetunes/{FINETUNE_ID}/finetune-assets/ \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
    -H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
    -F 'file_name=adapter_model.safetensors' \
    -F 'file=@{PATH/TO/adapter_model.safetensors}'
```

#### List fine-tunes in your account

You can call this method to confirm what fine-tunes you have created in your account

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `Workers AI Write`
* `Workers AI Read`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/finetunes" \
  --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": [

        "model": "@cf/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora",
        "name": "mistral-finetune",
        "description": "test"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Running inference with LoRAs

To make inference requests and apply the LoRA adapter, you will need your model and finetune `name` or `id`. You should use the chat template that your LoRA was trained on, but you can try running it with `raw: true` and the messages template like below.

* workers ai sdk

  ```javascript
  const response = await env.AI.run(
    "@cf/mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora", //the model supporting LoRAs
    {
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello world" }],
      raw: true, //skip applying the default chat template
      lora: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000", //the finetune id OR name
    },
  );
  ```

* rest api

  ```bash
  curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{ACCOUNT_ID}/ai/run/@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2-lora \
    -H 'Authorization: Bearer {API_TOKEN}' \
    -d '{
      "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello world"}],
      "raw": "true",
      "lora": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000"
    }'
  ```

Cloudflare offers a few public LoRA adapters that can immediately be used for fine-tuned inference. You can try them out immediately via our [playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com).

Public LoRAs will have the name `cf-public-x`, and the prefix will be reserved for Cloudflare.

Note

Have more LoRAs you would like to see? Let us know on [Discord](https://discord.cloudflare.com).

| Name | Description | Compatible with |
| - | - | - |
| [cf-public-magicoder](https://huggingface.co/predibase/magicoder) | Coding tasks in multiple languages | `@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1` `@hf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2` |
| [cf-public-jigsaw-classification](https://huggingface.co/predibase/jigsaw) | Toxic comment classification | `@cf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1` `@hf/mistral/mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2` |

You can also list these public LoRAs with an API call:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following [token permissions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/permissions/) is required:

* `Workers AI Write`
* `Workers AI Read`

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/ai/finetunes/public" \
  --request GET \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
```

## Running inference with public LoRAs

To run inference with public LoRAs, you just need to define the LoRA name in the request.

We recommend that you use the prompt template that the LoRA was trained on. You can find this in the HuggingFace repos linked above for each adapter.

The film showed a family in Switzerland collecting spaghetti from trees and many people were fooled into believing it, as in the 1950s British people didnt eat much pasta and many didnt know how it was made! Most British people wouldnt fall for the spaghetti trick today, but in 2008 the BBC managed to fool their audience again with their Miracles of Evolution trailer, which appeared to show some special penguins that had regained the ability to fly. Two major UK newspapers, The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mirror, published the important story on their front pages.",

This page shows how you can do traditional function calling, as defined by industry standards. Workers AI also offers [embedded function calling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/function-calling/embedded/), which is drastically easier than traditional function calling.

With traditional function calling, you define an array of tools with the name, description, and tool arguments. The example below shows how you would pass a tool called `getWeather` in an inference request to a model.

```js
const response = await env.AI.run("@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b", {
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "what is the weather in london?",
    },
  ],
  tools: [
    {
      name: "getWeather",
      description: "Return the weather for a latitude and longitude",
      parameters: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          latitude: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The latitude for the given location",
          },
          longitude: {
            type: "string",
            description: "The longitude for the given location",
          },
        },
        required: ["latitude", "longitude"],
      },
    },
  ],
});


return new Response(JSON.stringify(response.tool_calls));
```

The LLM will then return a JSON object with the required arguments and the name of the tool that was called. You can then pass this JSON object to make an API call.

```json
[
  {
    "arguments": { "latitude": "51.5074", "longitude": "-0.1278" },
    "name": "getWeather"
  }
]
```

For a working example on how to do function calling, take a look at our [demo app](https://github.com/craigsdennis/lightbulb-moment-tool-calling/blob/main/src/index.ts).

Cloudflare has a unique [embedded function calling](https://blog.cloudflare.com/embedded-function-calling) feature that allows you to execute function code alongside your tool call inference. Our npm package [`@cloudflare/ai-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/ai-utils) is the developer toolkit to get started.

Embedded function calling can be used to easily make complex agents that interact with websites and APIs, like using natural language to create meetings on Google Calendar, saving data to Notion, automatically routing requests to other APIs, saving data to an R2 bucket - or all of this at the same time. All you need is a prompt and an OpenAPI spec to get started.

REST API support

Embedded function calling depends on features native to the Workers platform. This means that embedded function calling is only supported via [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/), not via the [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/).

title: Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Build your first AI app with Cloudflare AI. This guide uses Workers
  AI, Vectorize, D1, and Cloudflare Workers.

---

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first application with Cloudflare AI. You will build a fully-featured AI-powered application, using tools like Workers AI, Vectorize, D1, and Cloudflare Workers.

Looking for a managed option?

[AI Search](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/) offers a fully managed way to build RAG pipelines on Cloudflare, handling ingestion, indexing, and querying out of the box. [Get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-search/get-started/).

At the end of this tutorial, you will have built an AI tool that allows you to store information and query it using a Large Language Model. This pattern, known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a useful project you can build by combining multiple aspects of Cloudflare's AI toolkit. You do not need to have experience working with AI tools to build this application.

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

You will also need access to [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/platform/pricing/). During this tutorial, we will show how you can optionally integrate with [Anthropic Claude](http://anthropic.com) as well. You will need an [Anthropic API key](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started) to do so.

## 1. Create a new Worker project

C3 (`create-cloudflare-cli`) is a command-line tool designed to help you setup and deploy Workers to Cloudflare as fast as possible.

Open a terminal window and run C3 to create your Worker project:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- rag-ai-tutorial
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare rag-ai-tutorial
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest rag-ai-tutorial
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `JavaScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

In your project directory, C3 has generated several files.

What files did C3 create?

1. `wrangler.jsonc`: Your [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#sample-wrangler-configuration) configuration file.
2. `worker.js` (in `/src`): A minimal `'Hello World!'` Worker written in [ES module](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/) syntax.
3. `package.json`: A minimal Node dependencies configuration file.
4. `package-lock.json`: Refer to [`npm` documentation on `package-lock.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-lock-json).
5. `node_modules`: Refer to [`npm` documentation `node_modules`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/folders#node-modules).

Now, move into your newly created directory:

```sh
cd rag-ai-tutorial
```

## 2. Develop with Wrangler CLI

The Workers command-line interface, [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), allows you to [create](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#init), [test](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev), and [deploy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) your Workers projects. C3 will install Wrangler in projects by default.

After you have created your first Worker, run the [`wrangler dev`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#dev) command in the project directory to start a local server for developing your Worker. This will allow you to test your Worker locally during development.

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

You will now be able to go to <http://localhost:8787> to see your Worker running. Any changes you make to your code will trigger a rebuild, and reloading the page will show you the up-to-date output of your Worker.

## 3. Adding the AI binding

To begin using Cloudflare's AI products, you can add the `ai` block to the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) as a [remote binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings). This will set up a binding to Cloudflare's AI models in your code that you can use to interact with the available AI models on the platform.

Note

If you have not used Wrangler before, it will try to open your web browser to login with your Cloudflare account.

If you have issues with this step or you do not have access to a browser interface, refer to the [`wrangler login`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#login) documentation for more information.

This example features the [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct` model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/), which generates text.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI",
      "remote": true
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  remote = true
  ```

Now, find the `src/index.js` file. Inside the `fetch` handler, you can query the `AI` binding:

```js
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const answer = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct", {
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: `What is the square root of 9?` }],
    });


    return new Response(JSON.stringify(answer));
  },
};
```

By querying the LLM through the `AI` binding, we can interact directly with Cloudflare AI's large language models directly in our code. In this example, we are using the [`@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct` model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3-8b-instruct/), which generates text.

You can deploy your Worker using `wrangler`:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Making a request to your Worker will now generate a text response from the LLM, and return it as a JSON object.

```sh
curl https://example.username.workers.dev
```

```sh
{"response":"Answer: The square root of 9 is 3."}
```

## 4. Adding embeddings using Cloudflare D1 and Vectorize

Embeddings allow you to add additional capabilities to the language models you can use in your Cloudflare AI projects. This is done via **Vectorize**, Cloudflare's vector database.

To begin using Vectorize, create a new embeddings index using `wrangler`. This index will store vectors with 768 dimensions, and will use cosine similarity to determine which vectors are most similar to each other:

```sh
npx wrangler vectorize create vector-index --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine
```

Then, add the configuration details for your new Vectorize index to the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "vectorize": [
      {
        "binding": "VECTOR_INDEX",
        "index_name": "vector-index"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # ... existing wrangler configuration


  [[vectorize]]
  binding = "VECTOR_INDEX"
  index_name = "vector-index"
  ```

A vector index allows you to store a collection of dimensions, which are floating point numbers used to represent your data. When you want to query the vector database, you can also convert your query into dimensions. **Vectorize** is designed to efficiently determine which stored vectors are most similar to your query.

To implement the searching feature, you must set up a D1 database from Cloudflare. In D1, you can store your app's data. Then, you change this data into a vector format. When someone searches and it matches the vector, you can show them the matching data.

Create a new D1 database using `wrangler`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create database
```

Then, paste the configuration details output from the previous command into the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "d1_databases": [
      {
        "binding": "DB",
        "database_name": "database",
        "database_id": "abc-def-geh"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # ... existing wrangler configuration


  [[d1_databases]]
  binding = "DB" # available in your Worker on env.DB
  database_name = "database"
  database_id = "abc-def-geh" # replace this with a real database_id (UUID)
  ```

In this application, we'll create a `notes` table in D1, which will allow us to store notes and later retrieve them in Vectorize. To create this table, run a SQL command using `wrangler d1 execute`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute database --remote --command "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, text TEXT NOT NULL)"
```

Now, we can add a new note to our database using `wrangler d1 execute`:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute database --remote --command "INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES ('The best pizza topping is pepperoni')"
```

## 5. Creating a workflow

Before we begin creating notes, we will introduce a [Cloudflare Workflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows). This will allow us to define a durable workflow that can safely and robustly execute all the steps of the RAG process.

To begin, add a new `[[workflows]]` block to your [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "workflows": [
      {
        "name": "rag",
        "binding": "RAG_WORKFLOW",
        "class_name": "RAGWorkflow"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  # ... existing wrangler configuration


  [[workflows]]
  name = "rag"
  binding = "RAG_WORKFLOW"
  class_name = "RAGWorkflow"
  ```

In `src/index.js`, add a new class called `RAGWorkflow` that extends `WorkflowEntrypoint`:

```js
import { WorkflowEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export class RAGWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
  async run(event, step) {
    await step.do("example step", async () => {
      console.log("Hello World!");
    });
  }
}
```

This class will define a single workflow step that will log "Hello World!" to the console. You can add as many steps as you need to your workflow.

On its own, this workflow will not do anything. To execute the workflow, we will call the `RAG_WORKFLOW` binding, passing in any parameters that the workflow needs to properly complete. Here is an example of how we can call the workflow:

```js
env.RAG_WORKFLOW.create({ params: { text } });
```

## 6. Creating notes and adding them to Vectorize

To expand on your Workers function in order to handle multiple routes, we will add `hono`, a routing library for Workers. This will allow us to create a new route for adding notes to our database. Install `hono` using `npm`:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i hono
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add hono
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add hono
  ```

Then, import `hono` into your `src/index.js` file. You should also update the `fetch` handler to use `hono`:

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";
const app = new Hono();


app.get("/", async (c) => {
  const answer = await c.env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct", {
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: `What is the square root of 9?` }],
  });


  return c.json(answer);
});


export default app;
```

This will establish a route at the root path `/` that is functionally equivalent to the previous version of your application.

Now, we can update our workflow to begin adding notes to our database, and generating the related embeddings for them.

This example features the [`@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5` model](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/bge-base-en-v1.5/), which can be used to create an embedding. Embeddings are stored and retrieved inside [Vectorize](https://developers.cloudflare.com/vectorize/), Cloudflare's vector database. The user query is also turned into an embedding so that it can be used for searching within Vectorize.

```js
import { WorkflowEntrypoint } from "cloudflare:workers";


export class RAGWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
  async run(event, step) {
    const env = this.env;
    const { text } = event.payload;


    const record = await step.do(`create database record`, async () => {
      const query = "INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES (?) RETURNING *";


      const { results } = await env.DB.prepare(query).bind(text).run();


      const record = results[0];
      if (!record) throw new Error("Failed to create note");
      return record;
    });


    const embedding = await step.do(`generate embedding`, async () => {
      const embeddings = await env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5", {
        text: text,
      });
      const values = embeddings.data[0];
      if (!values) throw new Error("Failed to generate vector embedding");
      return values;
    });


    await step.do(`insert vector`, async () => {
      return env.VECTOR_INDEX.upsert([
        {
          id: record.id.toString(),
          values: embedding,
        },
      ]);
    });
  }
}
```

The workflow does the following things:

1. Accepts a `text` parameter.
2. Insert a new row into the `notes` table in D1, and retrieve the `id` of the new row.
3. Convert the `text` into a vector using the `embeddings` model of the LLM binding.
4. Upsert the `id` and `vectors` into the `vector-index` index in Vectorize.

By doing this, you will create a new vector representation of the note, which can be used to retrieve the note later.

To complete the code, we will add a route that allows users to submit notes to the database. This route will parse the JSON request body, get the `note` parameter, and create a new instance of the workflow, passing the parameter:

```js
app.post("/notes", async (c) => {
  const { text } = await c.req.json();
  if (!text) return c.text("Missing text", 400);
  await c.env.RAG_WORKFLOW.create({ params: { text } });
  return c.text("Created note", 201);
});
```

## 7. Querying Vectorize to retrieve notes

To complete your code, you can update the root path (`/`) to query Vectorize. You will convert the query into a vector, and then use the `vector-index` index to find the most similar vectors.

The `topK` parameter limits the number of vectors returned by the function. For instance, providing a `topK` of 1 will only return the *most similar* vector based on the query. Setting `topK` to 5 will return the 5 most similar vectors.

Given a list of similar vectors, you can retrieve the notes that match the record IDs stored alongside those vectors. In this case, we are only retrieving a single note - but you may customize this as needed.

You can insert the text of those notes as context into the prompt for the LLM binding. This is the basis of Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG: providing additional context from data outside of the LLM to enhance the text generated by the LLM.

We'll update the prompt to include the context, and to ask the LLM to use the context when responding:

```js
import { Hono } from "hono";
const app = new Hono();


// Existing post route...
// app.post('/notes', async (c) => { ... })


app.get("/", async (c) => {
  const question = c.req.query("text") || "What is the square root of 9?";


  const embeddings = await c.env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5", {
    text: question,
  });
  const vectors = embeddings.data[0];


  const vectorQuery = await c.env.VECTOR_INDEX.query(vectors, { topK: 1 });
  let vecId;
  if (
    vectorQuery.matches &&
    vectorQuery.matches.length > 0 &&
    vectorQuery.matches[0]
  ) {
    vecId = vectorQuery.matches[0].id;
  } else {
    console.log("No matching vector found or vectorQuery.matches is empty");
  }


  let notes = [];
  if (vecId) {
    const query = `SELECT * FROM notes WHERE id = ?`;
    const { results } = await c.env.DB.prepare(query).bind(vecId).run();
    if (results) notes = results.map((vec) => vec.text);
  }


  const contextMessage = notes.length
    ? `Context:\n${notes.map((note) => `- ${note}`).join("\n")}`
    : "";


  const systemPrompt = `When answering the question or responding, use the context provided, if it is provided and relevant.`;


  const { response: answer } = await c.env.AI.run(
    "@cf/meta/llama-3-8b-instruct",
    {
      messages: [
        ...(notes.length ? [{ role: "system", content: contextMessage }] : []),
        { role: "system", content: systemPrompt },
        { role: "user", content: question },
      ],
    },
  );


  return c.text(answer);
});


app.onError((err, c) => {
  return c.text(err);
});


export default app;
```

## 8. Adding Anthropic Claude model (optional)

If you are working with larger documents, you have the option to use Anthropic's [Claude models](https://claude.ai/), which have large context windows and are well-suited to RAG workflows.

To begin, install the `@anthropic-ai/sdk` package:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i @anthropic-ai/sdk
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add @anthropic-ai/sdk
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add @anthropic-ai/sdk
  ```

In `src/index.js`, you can update the `GET /` route to check for the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable. If it's set, we can generate text using the Anthropic SDK. If it isn't set, we'll fall back to the existing Workers AI code:

```js
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';


app.get('/', async (c) => {
  // ... Existing code
  const systemPrompt = `When answering the question or responding, use the context provided, if it is provided and relevant.`


  let modelUsed: string = ""
  let response = null


  if (c.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) {
    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey: c.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    })


    const model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-latest"
    modelUsed = model


    const message = await anthropic.messages.create({
      max_tokens: 1024,
      model,
      messages: [
        { role: 'user', content: question }
      ],
      system: [systemPrompt, notes ? contextMessage : ''].join(" ")
    })


    response = {
      response: message.content.map(content => content.text).join("\n")
    }
  } else {
    const model = "@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"
    modelUsed = model


    response = await c.env.AI.run(
      model,
      {
        messages: [
          ...(notes.length ? [{ role: 'system', content: contextMessage }] : []),
          { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
          { role: 'user', content: question }
        ]
      }
    )
  }


  if (response) {
    c.header('x-model-used', modelUsed)
    return c.text(response.response)
  } else {
    return c.text("We were unable to generate output", 500)
  }
})
```

Finally, you'll need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your Workers application. You can do this by using `wrangler secret put`:

```sh
$ npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

## 9. Deleting notes and vectors

If you no longer need a note, you can delete it from the database. Any time that you delete a note, you will also need to delete the corresponding vector from Vectorize. You can implement this by building a `DELETE /notes/:id` route in your `src/index.js` file:

```js
app.delete("/notes/:id", async (c) => {
  const { id } = c.req.param();


  const query = `DELETE FROM notes WHERE id = ?`;
  await c.env.DB.prepare(query).bind(id).run();


  await c.env.VECTOR_INDEX.deleteByIds([id]);


  return c.status(204);
});
```

## 10. Text splitting (optional)

For large pieces of text, it is recommended to split the text into smaller chunks. This allows LLMs to more effectively gather relevant context, without needing to retrieve large pieces of text.

To implement this, we'll add a new NPM package to our project, \`@langchain/textsplitters':

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i @langchain/textsplitters
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add @langchain/textsplitters
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add @langchain/textsplitters
  ```

The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class provided by this package will split the text into smaller chunks. It can be customized to your liking, but the default config works in most cases:

```js
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";


const text = "Some long piece of text...";


const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  // These can be customized to change the chunking size
  // chunkSize: 1000,
  // chunkOverlap: 200,
});


const output = await splitter.createDocuments([text]);
console.log(output); // [{ pageContent: 'Some long piece of text...' }]
```

To use this splitter, we'll update the workflow to split the text into smaller chunks. We'll then iterate over the chunks and run the rest of the workflow for each chunk of text:

```js
export class RAGWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint {
  async run(event, step) {
    const env = this.env;
    const { text } = event.payload;
    let texts = await step.do("split text", async () => {
      const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter();
      const output = await splitter.createDocuments([text]);
      return output.map((doc) => doc.pageContent);
    });


    console.log(
      "RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter generated ${texts.length} chunks",
    );


    for (const index in texts) {
      const text = texts[index];
      const record = await step.do(
        `create database record: ${index}/${texts.length}`,
        async () => {
          const query = "INSERT INTO notes (text) VALUES (?) RETURNING *";


          const { results } = await env.DB.prepare(query).bind(text).run();


          const record = results[0];
          if (!record) throw new Error("Failed to create note");
          return record;
        },
      );


      const embedding = await step.do(
        `generate embedding: ${index}/${texts.length}`,
        async () => {
          const embeddings = await env.AI.run("@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5", {
            text: text,
          });
          const values = embeddings.data[0];
          if (!values) throw new Error("Failed to generate vector embedding");
          return values;
        },
      );


      await step.do(`insert vector: ${index}/${texts.length}`, async () => {
        return env.VECTOR_INDEX.upsert([
          {
            id: record.id.toString(),
            values: embedding,
          },
        ]);
      });
    }
  }
}
```

Now, when large pieces of text are submitted to the `/notes` endpoint, they will be split into smaller chunks, and each chunk will be processed by the workflow.

## 11. Deploy your project

If you did not deploy your Worker during [step 1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#1-create-a-new-worker-project), deploy your Worker via Wrangler, to a `*.workers.dev` subdomain, or a [Custom Domain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/routing/custom-domains/), if you have one configured. If you have not configured any subdomain or domain, Wrangler will prompt you during the publish process to set one up.

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

Preview your Worker at `<YOUR_WORKER>.<YOUR_SUBDOMAIN>.workers.dev`.

Note

When pushing to your `*.workers.dev` subdomain for the first time, you may see [`523` errors](https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-5xx-errors/error-523/) while DNS is propagating. These errors should resolve themselves after a minute or so.

## Related resources

A full version of this codebase is available on GitHub. It includes a frontend UI for querying, adding, and deleting notes, as well as a backend API for interacting with the database and vector index.

---

A handy way to explore all of the models available on [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai) is to use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

You can [download the DeepSeek Coder notebook](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/static/documentation/notebooks/deepseek-coder-exploration.ipynb) or view the embedded notebook below.

***

## Exploring Code Generation Using DeepSeek Coder

AI Models being able to generate code unlocks all sorts of use cases. The [DeepSeek Coder](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Coder) models `@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq` and `@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq` are now available on [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai).

Let's explore them using the API!

```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install requests python-dotenv
```

```plaintext
Requirement already satisfied: requests in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (2.31.0)
Requirement already satisfied: python-dotenv in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (1.0.1)
Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.3.2)
Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (3.6)
Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<3,>=1.21.1 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2.1.0)
Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages (from requests) (2023.11.17)
```

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass


from IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown, Audio


import requests
```

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv
```

### Configuring your environment

To use the API you'll need your [Cloudflare Account ID](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (head to Workers & Pages > Overview > Account details > Account ID) and a [Workers AI enabled API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

If you want to add these files to your environment, you can create a new file named `.env`

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" in os.environ:
    api_token = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"]
else:
    api_token = getpass("Enter you Cloudflare API Token")
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" in os.environ:
    account_id = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"]
else:
    account_id = getpass("Enter your account id")
```

### Generate code from a comment

A common use case is to complete the code for the user after they provide a descriptive comment.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq"


prompt = "# A function that checks if a given word is a palindrome"


response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
code = inference["result"]["response"]


display(Markdown(f"""
    ```python
    {prompt}
    {code.strip()}
````

"""))

````plaintext
```python
# A function that checks if a given word is a palindrome
def is_palindrome(word):
    # Convert the word to lowercase
    word = word.lower()


    # Reverse the word
    reversed_word = word[::-1]


    # Check if the reversed word is the same as the original word
    if word == reversed_word:
        return True
    else:
        return False


# Test the function
print(is_palindrome("racecar"))  # Output: True
print(is_palindrome("hello"))    # Output: False
````

### Assist in debugging

We've all been there, bugs happen. Sometimes those stacktraces can be very intimidating, and a great use case of using Code Generation is to assist in explaining the problem.

```python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"


system_message = "The user is going to give you code that isn't working. Explain to the user what might be wrong"


code = """# Welcomes our user
def hello_world(first_name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
"""


response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": code},
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(response))
```

The error in your code is that you are trying to use a variable `name` which is not defined anywhere in your function. The correct variable to use is `first_name`. So, you should change `f"Hello, {name}!"` to `f"Hello, {first_name}!"`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Welcomes our user
def hello_world(first_name="World"):
    print(f"Hello, {first_name}")
```

Now, when you call `hello_world()`, it will print "Hello, World" by default. If you call `hello_world("John")`, it will print "Hello, John".

### Write tests!

Writing unit tests is a common best practice. With the enough context, it's possible to write unit tests.

```python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"


system_message = "The user is going to give you code and would like to have tests written in the Python unittest module."


code = """
class User:


    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name=None):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        if last_name is None:
            self.last_name = "Mc" + self.first_name


    def full_name(self):
        return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
"""


response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": code},
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(response))
```

Here is a simple unittest test case for the User class:

```python
import unittest


class TestUser(unittest.TestCase):


    def test_full_name(self):
        user = User("John", "Doe")
        self.assertEqual(user.full_name(), "John Doe")


    def test_default_last_name(self):
        user = User("Jane")
        self.assertEqual(user.full_name(), "Jane McJane")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this test case, we have two tests:

* `test_full_name` tests the `full_name` method when the user has both a first name and a last name.
* `test_default_last_name` tests the `full_name` method when the user only has a first name and the last name is set to "Mc" + first name.

If all these tests pass, it means that the `full_name` method is working as expected. If any of these tests fail, it

### Fill-in-the-middle Code Completion

A common use case in Developer Tools is to autocomplete based on context. DeepSeek Coder provides the ability to submit existing code with a placeholder, so that the model can complete in context.

Warning: The tokens are prefixed with `<｜` and suffixed with `｜>` make sure to copy and paste them.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-base-awq"


code = """
<｜fim▁begin｜>import re


from jklol import email_service


def send_email(email_address, body):
    <｜fim▁hole｜>
    if not is_valid_email:
        raise InvalidEmailAddress(email_address)
    return email_service.send(email_address, body)<｜fim▁end｜>
"""


response = requests.post(
    f"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/ai/run/{model}",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_token}"},
    json={"messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": code}
    ]}
)
inference = response.json()
response = inference["result"]["response"]
display(Markdown(f"""
    ```python
    {response.strip()}
````

"""))

````plaintext
```python
is_valid_email = re.match(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+", email_address)
````

### Experimental: Extract data into JSON

No need to threaten the model or bring grandma into the prompt. Get back JSON in the format you want.

````python
model = "@hf/thebloke/deepseek-coder-6.7b-instruct-awq"

title: Whisper-large-v3-turbo with Cloudflare Workers AI · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Learn how to transcribe large audio files using Workers AI.
lastUpdated: 2025-08-19T18:37:36.000Z

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/build-a-workers-ai-whisper-with-chunking/index.md
---

In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* **Transcribe large audio files:** Use the [Whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/whisper-large-v3-turbo/) model from Cloudflare Workers AI to perform automatic speech recognition (ASR) or translation.
* **Handle large files:** Split large audio files into smaller chunks for processing, which helps overcome memory and execution time limitations.
* **Deploy using Cloudflare Workers:** Create a scalable, low‑latency transcription pipeline in a serverless environment.

## 1: Create a new Cloudflare Worker project

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

You will create a new Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` CLI (C3). [C3](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/create-cloudflare) is a command-line tool designed to help you set up and deploy new applications to Cloudflare.

Create a new project named `whisper-tutorial` by running:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- whisper-tutorial
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare whisper-tutorial
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest whisper-tutorial
  ```

Running `npm create cloudflare@latest` will prompt you to install the [`create-cloudflare` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cloudflare), and lead you through setup. C3 will also install [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), the Cloudflare Developer Platform CLI.

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `TypeScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

This will create a new `whisper-tutorial` directory. Your new `whisper-tutorial` directory will include:

* A `"Hello World"` [Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/#3-write-code) at `src/index.ts`.
* A [`wrangler.jsonc`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) configuration file.

Go to your application directory:

```sh
cd whisper-tutorial
```

## 2. Connect your Worker to Workers AI

You must create an AI binding for your Worker to connect to Workers AI. [Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Workers to interact with resources, like Workers AI, on the Cloudflare Developer Platform.

To bind Workers AI to your Worker, add the following to the end of your `wrangler.toml` file:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

Your binding is [available in your Worker code](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/migrate-to-module-workers/#bindings-in-es-modules-format) on [`env.AI`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/fetch/).

## 3. Configure Wrangler

In your wrangler file, add or update the following settings to enable Node.js APIs and polyfills (with a compatibility date of 2024‑09‑23 or later):

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23"
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat" ]
  compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
  ```

## 4. Handle large audio files with chunking

Replace the contents of your `src/index.ts` file with the following integrated code. This sample demonstrates how to:

(1) Extract an audio file URL from the query parameters.

(2) Fetch the audio file while explicitly following redirects.

(3) Split the audio file into smaller chunks (such as, 1 MB chunks).

(4) Transcribe each chunk using the Whisper-large-v3-turbo model via the Cloudflare AI binding.

(5) Return the aggregated transcription as plain text.

```ts
import { Buffer } from "node:buffer";
import type { Ai } from "workers-ai";


export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
  // If needed, add your KV namespace for storing transcripts.
  // MY_KV_NAMESPACE: KVNamespace;
}


/**
 * Fetches the audio file from the provided URL and splits it into chunks.
 * This function explicitly follows redirects.
 *
 * @param audioUrl - The URL of the audio file.
 * @returns An array of ArrayBuffers, each representing a chunk of the audio.
 */
async function getAudioChunks(audioUrl: string): Promise<ArrayBuffer[]> {
  const response = await fetch(audioUrl, { redirect: "follow" });
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch audio: ${response.status}`);
  }
  const arrayBuffer = await response.arrayBuffer();


  // Example: Split the audio into 1MB chunks.
  const chunkSize = 1024 * 1024; // 1MB
  const chunks: ArrayBuffer[] = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < arrayBuffer.byteLength; i += chunkSize) {
    const chunk = arrayBuffer.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
    chunks.push(chunk);
  }
  return chunks;
}


/**
 * Transcribes a single audio chunk using the Whisper‑large‑v3‑turbo model.
 * The function converts the audio chunk to a Base64-encoded string and
 * sends it to the model via the AI binding.
 *
 * @param chunkBuffer - The audio chunk as an ArrayBuffer.
 * @param env - The Cloudflare Worker environment, including the AI binding.
 * @returns The transcription text from the model.
 */
async function transcribeChunk(
  chunkBuffer: ArrayBuffer,
  env: Env,
): Promise<string> {
  const base64 = Buffer.from(chunkBuffer, "binary").toString("base64");
  const res = await env.AI.run("@cf/openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo", {
    audio: base64,
    // Optional parameters (uncomment and set if needed):
    // task: "transcribe",   // or "translate"
    // language: "en",
    // vad_filter: "false",
    // initial_prompt: "Provide context if needed.",
    // prefix: "Transcription:",
  });
  return res.text; // Assumes the transcription result includes a "text" property.
}


/**
 * The main fetch handler. It extracts the 'url' query parameter, fetches the audio,
 * processes it in chunks, and returns the full transcription.
 */
export default {
  async fetch(
    request: Request,
    env: Env,
    ctx: ExecutionContext,
  ): Promise<Response> {
    // Extract the audio URL from the query parameters.
    const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
    const audioUrl = searchParams.get("url");


    if (!audioUrl) {
      return new Response("Missing 'url' query parameter", { status: 400 });
    }


    // Get the audio chunks.
    const audioChunks: ArrayBuffer[] = await getAudioChunks(audioUrl);
    let fullTranscript = "";


    // Process each chunk and build the full transcript.
    for (const chunk of audioChunks) {
      try {
        const transcript = await transcribeChunk(chunk, env);
        fullTranscript += transcript + "\n";
      } catch (error) {
        fullTranscript += "[Error transcribing chunk]\n";
      }
    }


    return new Response(fullTranscript, {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "text/plain" },
    });
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## 5. Deploy your Worker

1. **Run the Worker locally:**

   Use wrangler's development mode to test your Worker locally:

```sh
npx wrangler dev
```

Open your browser and go to <http://localhost:8787>, or use curl:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8787?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/your-audio-file.mp3"
```

Replace the URL query parameter with the direct link to your audio file. (For GitHub-hosted files, ensure you use the raw file URL.)

1. **Deploy the Worker:**

   Once testing is complete, deploy your Worker with:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy
```

1. **Test the deployed Worker:**

   After deployment, test your Worker by passing the audio URL as a query parameter:

```sh
curl "https://<your-worker-subdomain>.workers.dev?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/your-audio-file.mp3"
```

Make sure to replace `<your-worker-subdomain>`, `your-username`, `your-repo`, and `your-audio-file.mp3` with your actual details.

If successful, the Worker will return a transcript of the audio file:

```sh
This is the transcript of the audio...
```

---

A handy way to explore all of the models available on [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai) is to use a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

You can [download the Workers AI notebook](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai-notebooks/cloudflare-workers-ai.ipynb) or view the embedded notebook below.

Or you can run this on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/craigsdennis/notebooks-cloudflare-workers-ai/blob/main/cloudflare-workers-ai.ipynb)

***

## Explore the Workers AI API using Python

[Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai) allows you to run machine learning models, on the Cloudflare network, from your own code – whether that be from Workers, Pages, or anywhere via REST API.

This notebook will explore the Workers AI REST API using the [official Python SDK](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-python).

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass


from cloudflare import Cloudflare
from IPython.display import display, Image, Markdown, Audio
import requests
```

```python
%load_ext dotenv
%dotenv
```

### Configuring your environment

To use the API you'll need your [Cloudflare Account ID](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Head to AI > Workers AI page and press the "Use REST API". This page will let you create a new API Token and copy your Account ID.

If you want to add these values to your environment variables, you can **create a new file** named `.env` and this notebook will read those values.

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"
```

Otherwise you can just enter the values securely when prompted below.

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" in os.environ:
    api_token = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"]
else:
    api_token = getpass("Enter you Cloudflare API Token")
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" in os.environ:
    account_id = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"]
else:
    account_id = getpass("Enter your account id")
```

```python
# Initialize client
client = Cloudflare(api_token=api_token)
```

```

# **Using Keyboard Shortcuts to Execute Cells in Jupyter Notebooks**

Executing cells in Jupyter Notebooks can be done quickly and efficiently using various keyboard shortcuts, saving you time and effort. Here are the shortcuts you can use:

**Mac**

* **Shift + Enter**: Execute the current cell and insert a new cell below.
* **Ctrl + Enter**: Execute the current cell and insert a new cell below, without creating a new output display.

**Windows/Linux**

* **Shift + Enter**: Execute the current cell and insert a new cell below.
* **Ctrl + Enter**: Execute the current cell and move to the next cell.

**Additional Shortcuts**

* **Alt + Enter**: Execute the current cell and create a new output display below (Mac), or move to the next cell (Windows/Linux).
* **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**: Execute the current cell and create a new output display below (Mac), or create a new cell below (Windows/Linux).

**Tips and Tricks**

* You can also use the **Run Cell** button in the Jupyter Notebook toolbar, or the **Run** menu option (macOS) or **Run -> Run Cell** (Windows/Linux).
* To execute a selection of cells, use **Shift + Alt + Enter** (Mac) or **Shift + Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux).
* To execute a cell and move to the next cell, use **Ctrl + Shift + Enter** (all platforms).

By using these keyboard shortcuts, you'll be able to work more efficiently and quickly in your Jupyter Notebooks. Happy coding!

declaration_of_independence = """In Congress, July 4, 1776. The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor."""

title: Fine Tune Models With AutoTrain from HuggingFace · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Fine-tuning AI models with LoRA adapters on Workers AI allows
  adding custom training data, like for LLM finetuning.

  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/fine-tune-models-with-autotrain/index.md
---

Fine tuning an AI model gives you the opportunity to add additional training data to the model. Workers AI allows for [Low-Rank Adaptation, LoRA, adapters](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/fine-tunes/loras/) that will allow you to finetune our models.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to create our own LoRAs. We will focus on [LLM Finetuning using AutoTrain](https://huggingface.co/docs/autotrain/llm_finetuning).

## 1. Create a CSV file with your training data

Start by creating a CSV, Comma Separated Values, file. This file will only have one column named `text`. Set the header by adding the word `text` on a line by itself.

Now you need to figure out what you want to add to your model.

Example formats are below:

```text
### Human: What is the meaning of life? ### Assistant: 42.
```

If your training row contains newlines, you should wrap it with quotes.

```text
"human: What is the meaning of life? \n bot: 42."
```

Different models, like Mistral, will provide a specific [chat template/instruction format](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1#instruction-format)

```text
<s>[INST] What is the meaning of life? [/INST] 42</s>
```

## 2. Configure the HuggingFace Autotrain Advanced Notebook

Open the [HuggingFace Autotrain Advanced Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/autotrain-advanced/blob/main/colabs/AutoTrain_LLM.ipynb)

In order to give your AutoTrain ample memory, you will need to need to choose a different Runtime. From the menu at the top of the Notebook choose Runtime > Change Runtime Type. Choose A100.

Note

These GPUs will cost money. A typical AutoTrain session typically costs less than $1 USD.

The notebook contains a few interactive sections that we will need to change.

### Project Config

Modify the following fields

* **project\_name**: Choose a descriptive name for you to remember later

* **model\_name**: Choose from the one of the official HuggingFace base models that we support:

  * `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`
  * `google/gemma-2b-it`
  * `google/gemma-7b-it`
  * `meta-llama/llama-2-7b-chat-hf`

### Optional Section: Push to Hub

Although not required to use AutoTrain, creating a [HuggingFace account](https://huggingface.co/join) will help you keep your finetune artifacts in a handy repository for you to refer to later.

If you do not perform the HuggingFace setup you can still download your files from the Notebook.

Follow the instructions [in the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/autotrain-advanced/blob/main/colabs/AutoTrain_LLM.ipynb) to create an account and token if necessary.

### Section: Hyperparameters

We only need to change a few of these fields to ensure things work on Cloudflare Workers AI.

* **quantization**: Change the drop down to `none`
* **lora-r**: Change the value to `8`

Warning

At the time of this writing, changing the quantization field breaks the code generation. You may need to edit the code and put quotes around the value.

Change the line that says `quantization = none` to `quantization = "none"`.

## 3. Upload your CSV file to the Notebook

Notebooks have a folder structure which you can access by clicking the folder icon on the left hand navigation bar.

Create a folder named data.

You can drag your CSV file into the notebook.

Ensure that it is named **train.csv**

## 4. Execute the Notebook

In the Notebook menu, choose Runtime > Run All.

It will run through each cell of the notebook, first doing installations, then configuring and running your AutoTrain session.

This might take some time depending on the size of your train.csv file.

If you encounter the following error, it is caused by an Out of Memory error. You might want to change your runtime to a bigger GPU backend.

```bash
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['/usr/bin/python3', '-m', 'autotrain.trainers.clm', '--training_config', 'blog-instruct/training_params.json']' died with <Signals.SIGKILL: 9>.
```

## 5. Download The LoRA

### Optional: HuggingFace

If you pushed to HuggingFace you will find your new model card that you named in **project\_name** above. Your model card is private by default. Navigate to the files and download the files listed below.

### Notebook

In your Notebook you can also find the needed files. A new folder that matches your **project\_name** will be there.

Download the following files:

* `adapter_model.safetensors`
* `adapter_config.json`

## 6. Update Adapter Config

You need to add one line to your `adapter_config.json` that you downloaded.

`"model_type": "mistral"`

Where `model_type` is the architecture. Current valid values are `mistral`, `gemma`, and `llama`.

## 7. Upload the Fine Tune to your Cloudflare Account

Now that you have your files, you can add them to your account.

You can either use the [REST API or Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/fine-tunes/loras/).

## 8. Use your Fine Tune in your Generations

After you have your new fine tune all set up, you are ready to [put it to use in your inference requests](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/fine-tunes/loras/#running-inference-with-loras).

## How to Choose The Right Text Generation Model

Models come in different shapes and sizes, and choosing the right one for the task, can cause analysis paralysis.

The good news is that on the [Workers AI Text Generation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/) interface is always the same, no matter which model you choose.

In an effort to aid you in your journey of finding the right model, this notebook will help you get to know your options in a speed dating type of scenario.

### Configuring your environment

To use the API you'll need your [Cloudflare Account ID](https://dash.cloudflare.com) (head to Workers & Pages > Overview > Account details > Account ID) and a [Workers AI enabled API Token](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

If you want to add these files to your environment, you can create a new file named `.env`

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="YOUR-TOKEN"
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID"
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" in os.environ:
    api_token = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"]
else:
    api_token = getpass("Enter you Cloudflare API Token")
```

```python
if "CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID" in os.environ:
    account_id = os.environ["CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID"]
else:
    account_id = getpass("Enter your account id")
```

```python

            display(Markdown(quoted_question + "\n"))
            try:
                official_model_name = model.split("/")[-1]
                start = timer()
                response = requests.post(

                    ]}
                )
                elapsed = timer() - start
                inference = response.json()

How about "Echo and Echo"? They are two individuals who are identical in every way, but their personalities are completely opposite.

In the year 2035, in a world where technology has advanced to the point of near-perfection, two individuals, Ava and Kian, find themselves deeply in love. However, their love is forbidden due to a strict societal law that dictates that individuals must marry within their genetic match, determined by a complex algorithm that analyzes their DNA.

Ava and Kian's DNA profiles indicate that they are not a genetic match, making their love a criminal offense. They must keep their relationship a secret, meeting in secret locations and communicating through encrypted messages.

Their love is not just forbidden, but also dangerous. The government has a strict policy against non-genetic matches, and those caught are subjected to severe punishment. Ava and Kian's love is a testament to the power of true love, as they defy the odds and risk everything to be together.

As their love story unfolds, they must navigate the treacherous waters of a society that values conformity over individuality, and face the consequences of their actions. Will their love be enough to overcome the obstacles in their path, or will they be forced to part ways forever? Only time

Ah, a love story set in the near future, how intriguing! I've got just the name for your star-crossed lovers. How about "Echo and Nova"?

Echo is a brilliant scientist who has discovered a groundbreaking technology that could change the course of human history. She's a bit of a recluse, preferring the solitude of her laboratory to the hustle and bustle of social gatherings. Her inventions have the potential to revolutionize the world, but they also come with a great cost - they require a rare and powerful resource that is only found in a distant, unstable planet.

Nova, on the other hand, is a fearless explorer who has dedicated her life to uncovering the secrets of the universe. She's charismatic, fearless, and has a natural talent for leadership. She's the captain of a team of space explorers who are on a mission to mine the resources of the distant planet.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) with Workers and Workers AI enabled.
2. Your `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN`.
   * You can generate an API token in your Cloudflare dashboard under API Tokens.
3. Node.js installed for working with Cloudflare Workers (optional but recommended).

## 1. Agree to Meta's license

The first time you use the [Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct) model, you need to agree to Meta's License and Acceptable Use Policy.

```bash
curl https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/ai/run/@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{ "prompt": "agree" }'
```

Replace `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `$CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_TOKEN` with your actual account ID and token.

## 2. Set up your Cloudflare Worker

1. Create a Worker Project You will create a new Worker project using the `create-cloudflare` CLI (`C3`). This tool simplifies setting up and deploying new applications to Cloudflare.

   Run the following command in your terminal:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- llama-vision-tutorial
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare llama-vision-tutorial
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest llama-vision-tutorial
  ```

For setup, select the following options:

* For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Hello World example`.
* For *Which template would you like to use?*, choose `Worker only`.
* For *Which language do you want to use?*, choose `JavaScript`.
* For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
* For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

After completing the setup, a new directory called `llama-vision-tutorial` will be created.

1. Navigate to your application directory Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd llama-vision-tutorial
   ```

2. Project structure Your `llama-vision-tutorial` directory will include:

   * A "Hello World" Worker at `src/index.ts`.
   * A `wrangler.json` configuration file for managing deployment settings.

## 3. Write the Worker code

Edit the `src/index.ts` (or `index.js` if you are not using TypeScript) file and replace the content with the following code:

```javascript
export interface Env {
  AI: Ai;
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env): Promise<Response> {
    const messages = [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
      { role: "user", content: "Describe the image I'm providing." },
    ];


    // Replace this with your image data encoded as base64 or a URL
    const imageBase64 = "data:image/png;base64,IMAGE_DATA_HERE";


    const response = await env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct", {
      messages,
      image: imageBase64,
    });


    return Response.json(response);
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## 4. Bind Workers AI to your Worker

1. Open the [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) and add the following configuration:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "env": {},
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [env]
  [ai]
  binding="AI"
  ```

1. Save the file.

## 5. Deploy the Worker

Run the following command to deploy your Worker:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## 6. Test Your Worker

1. After deployment, you will receive a unique URL for your Worker (e.g., `https://llama-vision-tutorial.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`).
2. Use a tool like `curl` or Postman to send a request to your Worker:

```bash
curl -X POST https://llama-vision-tutorial.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev \
  -d '{ "image": "BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE" }'
```

Replace `BASE64_ENCODED_IMAGE` with an actual base64-encoded image string.

## 7. Verify the response

The response will include the output from the model, such as a description or answer to your prompt based on the image provided.

Example response:

```json
{
  "result": "This is a golden retriever sitting in a grassy park."
}
```

title: Using BigQuery with Workers AI · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Learn how to ingest data stored outside of Cloudflare as an input
  to Workers AI models.
lastUpdated: 2025-10-13T13:40:40.000Z

tags: AI,JavaScript
source_url:
  html: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/using-bigquery-with-workers-ai/
  md: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/using-bigquery-with-workers-ai/index.md
---

The easiest way to get started with [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) is to try it out in the [Multi-modal Playground](https://multi-modal.ai.cloudflare.com/) and the [LLM playground](https://playground.ai.cloudflare.com/). If you decide that you want to integrate your code with Workers AI, you may then decide to use its [REST API endpoints](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/rest-api/) or a [Worker binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/configuration/bindings/).

But what about the data? What if you want these models to ingest data that is stored outside Cloudflare?

In this tutorial, you will learn how to bring data from Google BigQuery to a Cloudflare Worker so that it can be used as input for Workers AI models.

## Prerequisites

You will need:

* A [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) project running a [Hello World script](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).
* A Google Cloud Platform [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#iam-service-accounts-create-console) with an [associated key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#iam-service-account-keys-create-console) file downloaded that has read access to BigQuery.
* Access to a BigQuery table with some test data that allows you to create a [BigQuery Job Query](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/jobs/query). For this tutorial it is recommended you that you create your own table as [sampled tables](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data#sample_tables), unless cloned to your own GCP namespace, won't allow you to run job queries against them. For this example, the [Hacker News Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-corpus) was used under its MIT licence.

## 1. Set up your Cloudflare Worker

To ingest the data into Cloudflare and feed it into Workers AI, you will be using a [Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/). If you have not created one yet, please review our [tutorial on how to get started](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/).

After following the steps to create a Worker, you should have the following code in your new Worker project:

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  },
};
```

If the Worker project has successfully been created, you should also be able to run `npx wrangler dev` in a console to run the Worker locally:

```sh
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

Open a browser tab at `http://localhost:8787/` to see your deployed Worker. Please note that the port `8787` may be a different one in your case.

You should be seeing `Hello World!` in your browser:

```sh
Hello World!
```

If you run into any issues during this step, please review the [Worker's Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/).

## 2. Import GCP Service key into the Worker as Secrets

Now that you have verified that the Worker has been created successfully, you will need to reference the Google Cloud Platform service key created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section of this tutorial.

Your downloaded key JSON file from Google Cloud Platform should have the following format:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<your_project_id>",
  "private_key_id": "<your_private_key_id>",
  "private_key": "<your_private_key>",
  "client_email": "<your_service_account_id>@<your_project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<your_oauth2_client_id>",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/<your_service_account_id>%40<your_project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```

For this tutorial, you will only need the values of the following fields: `client_email`, `private_key`, `private_key_id`, and `project_id`.

Instead of storing this information in plain text in the Worker, you will use [Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) to make sure its unencrypted content is only accessible via the Worker itself.

Import those three values from the JSON file into Secrets, starting with the field from the JSON key file called `client_email`, which we will now call `BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL` (you can use another variable name):

```sh
npx wrangler secret put BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL
```

You will be asked to enter a secret value, which will be the value of the field `client_email` in the JSON key file.

Note

Do not include any double quotes in the secret that you store, as it will already be interpreted as a string.

If the secret was uploaded successfully, the following message will be displayed:

```sh
✨ Success! Uploaded secret BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL
```

Now import the secrets for the three remaining fields; `private_key`, `private_key_id`, and `project_id` as `BQ_PRIVATE_KEY`, `BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`, and `BQ_PROJECT_ID` respectively:

```sh
npx wrangler secret put BQ_PRIVATE_KEY
```

```sh
npx wrangler secret put BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
```

```sh
npx wrangler secret put BQ_PROJECT_ID
```

At this point, you have successfully imported three fields from the JSON key file downloaded from Google Cloud Platform into Cloudflare Secrets to be used in a Worker.

[Secrets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/) are only made available to Workers once they are deployed. To make them available during development, [create a `.dev.vars`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/secrets/#local-development-with-secrets) file to locally store these credentials and reference them as environment variables.

Your `dev.vars` file should look like the following:

```plaintext
BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL="<your_service_account_id>@<your_project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
BQ_CLIENT_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----<content_of_your_private_key>-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="<your_private_key_id>"
BQ_PROJECT_ID="<your_project_id>"
```

Make sure to include `.dev.vars` in your project `.gitignore` file to prevent your credentials being uploaded to a repository when using version control.

Check the secrets are loaded correctly in `src/index.js` by logging their values into a console output, as follows:

```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    console.log("BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL: ", env.BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL);
    console.log("BQ_PRIVATE_KEY: ", env.BQ_PRIVATE_KEY);
    console.log("BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID: ", env.BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID);
    console.log("BQ_PROJECT_ID: ", env.BQ_PROJECT_ID);
    return new Response("Hello World!");
  },
};
```

Restart the Worker and run `npx wrangler dev`. You should see that the server now mentions the newly added variables:

```plaintext
Using vars defined in .dev.vars
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Vars:
  - BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL: "(hidden)"
  - BQ_PRIVATE_KEY: "(hidden)"
  - BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID: "(hidden)"
  - BQ_PROJECT_ID: "(hidden)"
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

If you open `http://localhost:8787` in your browser, you should see the values of the variables show up in your console where the `npx wrangler dev` command is running, while still seeing only the `Hello World!` text in the browser window.

You now have access to the GCP credentials from a Worker. Next, you will install a library to help with the creation of the JSON Web Token needed to interact with GCP's API.

## 3. Install library to handle JWT operations

To interact with BigQuery's REST API, you will need to generate a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction) to authenticate your requests using the credentials that you have loaded into Worker secrets in the previous step.

For this tutorial, you will be using the [jose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jose?activeTab=readme) library for JWT-related operations. Install it by running the following command in a console:

```sh
npm i jose
```

To verify that the installation succeeded, you can run `npm list`, which lists all the installed packages, to check if the `jose` dependency has been added:

```sh
<project_name>@0.0.0
/<path_to_your_project>/<project_name>
├── @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers@0.4.29
├── jose@5.9.2
├── vitest@1.5.0
└── wrangler@3.75.0
```

## 4. Generate JSON web token

Now that you have installed the `jose` library, it is time to import it and add a function to your code that generates a signed JSON Web Token (JWT):

```javascript
import * as jose from 'jose';
...
const generateBQJWT = async (aCryptoKey, env) => {
const algorithm = "RS256";
const audience = "https://bigquery.googleapis.com/";
const expiryAt = (new Date().valueOf() / 1000);
  const privateKey = await jose.importPKCS8(env.BQ_PRIVATE_KEY, algorithm);


  // Generate signed JSON Web Token (JWT)
  return new jose.SignJWT()
      .setProtectedHeader({
          typ: 'JWT',
          alg: algorithm,
          kid: env.BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
      })
      .setIssuer(env.BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL)
      .setSubject(env.BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL)
      .setAudience(audience)
      .setExpirationTime(expiryAt)
      .setIssuedAt()
      .sign(privateKey)
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
       ...
// Create JWT to authenticate the BigQuery API call
      let bqJWT;
      try {
          bqJWT = await generateBQJWT(env);
      } catch (e) {
          return new Response('An error has occurred while generating the JWT', { status: 500 })
      }
  },
       ...
};
```

Now that you have created a JWT, it is time to do an API call to BigQuery to fetch some data.

## 5. Make authenticated requests to Google BigQuery

With the JWT token created in the previous step, issue an API request to BigQuery's API to retrieve data from a table.

You will now query the table that you created in BigQuery earlier in this tutorial. This example uses a sampled version of the [Hacker News Corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hacker-news/hacker-news-corpus) that was used under its MIT licence and uploaded to BigQuery.

```javascript
const queryBQ = async (bqJWT, path) => {
  const bqEndpoint = `https://bigquery.googleapis.com${path}`
  // In this example, text is a field in the BigQuery table that is being queried (hn.news_sampled)
  const query = 'SELECT text FROM hn.news_sampled LIMIT 3';
  const response = await fetch(bqEndpoint, {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
          "query": query
      }),
      headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${bqJWT}`
      }
  })
  return response.json()
}
...
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    ...
        let ticketInfo;
        try {
        ticketInfo = await queryBQ(bqJWT);
      } catch (e) {
          return new Response('An error has occurred while querying BQ', { status: 500 });
      }
  ...
  },
};
```

Having the raw row data from BigQuery means that you can now format it in a JSON-like style next.

## 6. Format results from the query

Now that you have retrieved the data from BigQuery, your BigQuery API response should look something like this:

```json
{
  ...
  "schema": {
      "fields": [
          {
              "name": "title",
              "type": "STRING",
              "mode": "NULLABLE"
          },
          {
              "name": "text",
              "type": "STRING",
              "mode": "NULLABLE"
          }
      ]
  },
  ...
  "rows": [
      {
          "f": [
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              },
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              }
          ]
      },
      {
          "f": [
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              },
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              }
          ]
      },
      {
          "f": [
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              },
              {
                  "v": "<some_value>"
              }
          ]
      }
  ],
  ...
}
```

This format may be difficult to read and work with when iterating through results. So you will now implement a function that maps the schema into each individual value, and the resulting output will be easier to read, as shown below. Each row corresponds to an object within an array.

```javascript
[
  {
    title: "<some_value>",
    text: "<some_value>",
  },
  {
    title: "<some_value>",
    text: "<some_value>",
  },
  {
    title: "<some_value>",
    text: "<some_value>",
  },
];
```

Create a `formatRows` function that takes a number of rows and fields returned from the BigQuery response body and returns an array of results as objects with named fields.

```javascript
const formatRows = (rowsWithoutFieldNames, fields) => {
  // Index to fieldName
  const fieldsByIndex = new Map();


  // Load all fields by name and have their index in the array result as their key
  fields.forEach((field, index) => {
      fieldsByIndex.set(index, field.name)
  })


  // Iterate through rows
  const rowsWithFieldNames = rowsWithoutFieldNames.map(row => {
      // Per each row represented by an array f, iterate through the unnamed values and find their field names by searching them in the fieldsByIndex.
      let newRow = {}
      row.f.forEach((field, index) => {
          const fieldName = fieldsByIndex.get(index);
          if (fieldName) {
    // For every field in a row, add them to newRow
              newRow = ({ ...newRow, [fieldName]: field.v });
          }
      })
      return newRow
  })


  return rowsWithFieldNames
}


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    ...
      // Transform output format into array of objects with named fields
      let formattedResults;


      if ('rows' in ticketInfo) {
          formattedResults = formatRows(ticketInfo.rows, ticketInfo.schema.fields);
          console.log(formattedResults)
      } else if ('error' in ticketInfo) {
          return new Response(ticketInfo.error.message, { status: 500 })
      }
  ...
  },
};
```

## 7. Feed data into Workers AI

Now that you have converted the response from the BigQuery API into an array of results, generate some tags and attach an associated sentiment score using an LLM via [Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/):

```javascript
const generateTags = (data, env) => {
  return env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
      prompt: `Create three one-word tags for the following text. return only these three tags separated by a comma. don't return text that is not a category.Lowercase only. ${JSON.stringify(data)}`,
  });
}


const generateSentimentScore = (data, env) => {
  return env.AI.run("@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct", {
      prompt: `return a float number between 0 and 1 measuring the sentiment of the following text. 0 being negative and 1 positive. return only the number, no text. ${JSON.stringify(data)}`,
  });
}


// Iterates through values, sends them to an AI handler and encapsulates all responses into a single Promise
const getAIGeneratedContent = (data, env, aiHandler) => {
  let results = data?.map(dataPoint => {
      return aiHandler(dataPoint, env)
  })
  return Promise.all(results)
}
...
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    ...
let summaries, sentimentScores;
      try {
          summaries = await getAIGeneratedContent(formattedResults, env, generateTags);
          sentimentScores = await getAIGeneratedContent(formattedResults, env, generateSentimentScore)
      } catch {
          return new Response('There was an error while generating the text summaries or sentiment scores')
      }
},


formattedResults = formattedResults?.map((formattedResult, i) => {
          if (sentimentScores[i].response && summaries[i].response) {
              return {
                  ...formattedResult,
                  'sentiment': parseFloat(sentimentScores[i].response).toFixed(2),
                  'tags': summaries[i].response.split(',').map((result) => result.trim())
              }
          }
      }
};
```

Uncomment the following lines from the Wrangler file in your project:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "ai": {
      "binding": "AI"
    }
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [ai]
  binding = "AI"
  ```

Restart the Worker that is running locally, and after doing so, go to your application endpoint:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8787
```

It is likely that you will be asked to log in to your Cloudflare account and grant temporary access to Wrangler (the Cloudflare CLI) to use your account when using Worker AI.

Once you access `http://localhost:8787` you should see an output similar to the following:

```sh
{
  "data": [
  {
    "text": "You can see a clear spike in submissions right around US Thanksgiving.",
    "sentiment": "0.61",
    "tags": [
      "trends",
      "submissions",
      "thanksgiving"
    ]

The actual values and fields will mostly depend on the query made in Step 5 that is then fed into the LLM.

## Final result

All the code shown in the different steps is combined into the following code in `src/index.js`:

```javascript
import * as jose from "jose";


const generateBQJWT = async (env) => {
  const algorithm = "RS256";
  const audience = "https://bigquery.googleapis.com/";
  const expiryAt = new Date().valueOf() / 1000;

      typ: "JWT",
      alg: algorithm,
      kid: env.BQ_PRIVATE_KEY_ID,
    })
    .setIssuer(env.BQ_CLIENT_EMAIL)

    const response = { data: formattedResults };


    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response), {
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
  },
};
```

If you wish to deploy this Worker, you can do so by running `npx wrangler deploy`:

```sh
Total Upload: <size_of_your_worker> KiB / gzip: <compressed_size_of_your_worker> KiB
Uploaded <name_of_your_worker> (x sec)
Deployed <name_of_your_worker> triggers (x sec)
  https://<your_public_worker_endpoint>
Current Version ID: <worker_script_version_id>
```

This will create a public endpoint that you can use to access the Worker globally. Please keep this in mind when using production data, and make sure to include additional access controls in place.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you have learnt how to integrate Google BigQuery and Cloudflare Workers by creating a GCP service account key and storing part of it as Worker secrets. This was later imported in the code, and by using the `jose` npm library, you created a JSON Web Token to authenticate the API query to BigQuery.

Once you obtained the results, you formatted them to pass to generative AI models via Workers AI to generate tags and to perform sentiment analysis on the extracted data.

## Next Steps

If, instead of displaying the results of ingesting the data to the AI model in a browser, your workflow requires fetching and store data (for example in [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) or [D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/)) on regular intervals, you may want to consider adding a [scheduled handler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/handlers/scheduled/) for this Worker. This enables you to trigger the Worker with a predefined cadence via a [Cron Trigger](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/cron-triggers/). Consider reviewing the Reference Architecture Diagrams on [Ingesting BigQuery Data into Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/bigquery-workers-ai/).

A use case to ingest data from other sources, like you did in this tutorial, is to create a RAG system. If this sounds relevant to you, please check out the [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AI tutorial](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/guides/tutorials/build-a-retrieval-augmented-generation-ai/).

Learn more about the API reference for [embedded function calling](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/features/function-calling/embedded).

## runWithTools

This wrapper method enables you to do embedded function calling. You pass it the AI binding, model, inputs (`messages` array and `tools` array), and optional configurations.

* `AI Binding`Ai
  * The AI binding, such as `env.AI`.

* `model`BaseAiTextGenerationModels
  * The ID of the model that supports function calling. For example, `@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b`.

* `input`Object

  * `messages`RoleScopedChatInput\[]
  * `tools`AiTextGenerationToolInputWithFunction\[]

* `config`Object

  * `streamFinalResponse`boolean optional
  * `maxRecursiveToolRuns`number optional
  * `strictValidation`boolean optional
  * `verbose`boolean optional
  * `trimFunction`boolean optional - For the `trimFunction`, you can pass it `autoTrimTools`, which is another helper method we've devised to automatically choose the correct tools (using an LLM) before sending it off for inference. This means that your final inference call will have fewer input tokens.

## createToolsFromOpenAPISpec

This method lets you automatically create tool schemas based on OpenAPI specs, so you don't have to manually write or hardcode the tool schemas. You can pass the OpenAPI spec for any API in JSON or YAML format.

`createToolsFromOpenAPISpec` has a config input that allows you to perform overrides if you need to provide headers like Authentication or User-Agent.

* `spec`string
  * The OpenAPI specification in either JSON or YAML format, or a URL to a remote OpenAPI specification.

* `config`Config optional - Configuration options for the createToolsFromOpenAPISpec function

  * `overrides`ConfigRule\[] optional
  * `matchPatterns`RegExp\[] optional
  * `options` Object optional { `verbose` boolean optional }

This guide will instruct you through setting up and deploying your first Workers AI project with embedded function calling. You will use Workers, a Workers AI binding, the [`ai-utils package`](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai-utils), and a large language model (LLM) to deploy your first AI-powered application on the Cloudflare global network with embedded function calling.

## 1. Create a Worker project with Workers AI

Follow the [Workers AI Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/) until step 2.

## 2. Install additional npm package

Next, run the following command in your project repository to install the Worker AI utilities package.

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i @cloudflare/ai-utils
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add @cloudflare/ai-utils
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add @cloudflare/ai-utils
  ```

## 3. Add Workers AI Embedded function calling

Update the `index.ts` file in your application directory with the following code:

* JavaScript

  ```js
  import { runWithTools } from "@cloudflare/ai-utils";


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      // Define function
      const sum = (args) => {
        const { a, b } = args;
        return Promise.resolve((a + b).toString());
      };
      // Run AI inference with function calling
      const response = await runWithTools(
        env.AI,
        // Model with function calling support
        "@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b",
        {
          // Messages
          messages: [
            {
              role: "user",
              content: "What the result of 123123123 + 10343030?",
            },
          ],
          // Definition of available tools the AI model can leverage
          tools: [
            {
              name: "sum",
              description: "Sum up two numbers and returns the result",
              parameters: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  a: { type: "number", description: "the first number" },
                  b: { type: "number", description: "the second number" },
                },
                required: ["a", "b"],
              },
              // reference to previously defined function
              function: sum,
            },
          ],
        },
      );
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  };
  ```

* TypeScript

  ```ts
  import { runWithTools } from "@cloudflare/ai-utils";


  type Env = {
    AI: Ai;
  };


  export default {
    async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
      // Define function
      const sum = (args: { a: number; b: number }): Promise<string> => {
        const { a, b } = args;
        return Promise.resolve((a + b).toString());
      };
      // Run AI inference with function calling
      const response = await runWithTools(
        env.AI,
        // Model with function calling support
        "@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b",
        {
          // Messages
          messages: [
            {
              role: "user",
              content: "What the result of 123123123 + 10343030?",
            },
          ],
          // Definition of available tools the AI model can leverage
          tools: [
            {
              name: "sum",
              description: "Sum up two numbers and returns the result",
              parameters: {
                type: "object",
                properties: {
                  a: { type: "number", description: "the first number" },
                  b: { type: "number", description: "the second number" },
                },
                required: ["a", "b"],
              },
              // reference to previously defined function
              function: sum,
            },
          ],
        },
      );
      return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
    },
  } satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
  ```

This example imports the utils with `import { runWithTools} from "@cloudflare/ai-utils"` and follows the API reference below.

Moreover, in this example we define and describe a list of tools that the LLM can leverage to respond to the user query. Here, the list contains of only one tool, the `sum` function.

Abstracted by the `runWithTools` function, the following steps occur:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Worker as Worker
    participant WorkersAI as Workers AI

    Worker->>+WorkersAI: Send messages, function calling prompt, and available tools
    WorkersAI->>+Worker: Select tools and arguments for function calling
    Worker-->>-Worker: Execute function
    Worker-->>+WorkersAI: Send messages, function calling prompt and function result
    WorkersAI-->>-Worker: Send response incorporating function output
```

The `ai-utils package` is also open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/cloudflare/ai-utils).

## 4. Local development & deployment

Follow steps 4 and 5 of the [Workers AI Get Started Guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/get-started/workers-wrangler/) for local development and deployment.

Workers AI Embedded Function Calling charges

Embedded function calling runs Workers AI inference requests. Standard charges for inference (e.g. tokens) usage will be charged. Resources consumed (e.g. CPU time) during embedded functions' code execution will be charged just as any other Worker's code execution.

---

This section will describe tools for troubleshooting and address common errors.

## Logging

General [logging](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/) capabilities for Workers also apply to embedded function calling.

### Function invocations

The invocations of tools can be logged as in any Worker using `console.log()`:

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const sum = (args: { a: number; b: number }): Promise<string> => {
      const { a, b } = args;
      // Logging from within embedded function invocations
      console.log(`The sum function has been invoked with the arguments a: ${a} and b: ${b}`)
      return Promise.resolve((a + b).toString());
    };
    ...
  }
}
```

### Logging within `runWithTools`

The `runWithTools` function has a `verbose` mode that emits helpful logs for debugging of function calls as well input and output statistics.

```ts
const response = await runWithTools(
  env.AI,
  '@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b',
  {
    messages: [
      ...
    ],
    tools: [
      ...
    ],
  },
  // Enable verbose mode
  { verbose: true }
);
```

## Performance

To respond to a LLM prompt with embedded function, potentially multiple AI inference requests and function invocations are needed, which can have an impact on user experience.

Consider the following to improve performance:

* Shorten prompts (to reduce time for input processing)
* Reduce number of tools provided
* Stream the final response to the end user (to minimize the time to interaction). See example below:

```ts
async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
  const response = (await runWithTools(
    env.AI,
    '@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b',
    {
      messages: [
        ...
      ],
      tools: [
        ...
      ],
    },
    {
      // Enable response streaming
      streamFinalResponse: true,
    }
  )) as ReadableStream;


  // Set response headers for streaming
  return new Response(response, {
    headers: {
      'content-type': 'text/event-stream',
    },
  });
}
```

## Common Errors

If you are getting a `BadInput` error, your inputs may exceed our current context window for our models. Try reducing input tokens to resolve this error.

  enable LLMs to perform API calls, like retrieving a 5-day weather forecast
  using function calling.

A very common use case is to provide the LLM with the ability to perform API calls via function calling.

In this example the LLM will retrieve the weather forecast for the next 5 days. To do so a `getWeather` function is defined that is passed to the LLM as tool.

The `getWeather`function extracts the user's location from the request and calls the external weather API via the Workers' [`Fetch API`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/) and returns the result.

```ts
import { runWithTools } from '@cloudflare/ai-utils';


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Define function
    const getWeather = async (args: { numDays: number }) => {
      const { numDays } = args;
      // Location is extracted from request based on
      // https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#incomingrequestcfproperties
      const lat = request.cf?.latitude
      const long = request.cf?.longitude


      // Interpolate values for external API call
      const response = await fetch(
        `https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${long}&daily=temperature_2m_max,precipitation_sum&timezone=GMT&forecast_days=${numDays}`
      );
      return response.text();
    };
    // Run AI inference with function calling
    const response = await runWithTools(
      env.AI,
      // Model with function calling support
      '@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b',
      {
        // Messages
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'What the weather like the next 5 days? Respond as text',
          },
        ],
        // Definition of available tools the AI model can leverage
        tools: [
          {
            name: 'getWeather',
            description: 'Get the weather for the next [numDays] days',
            parameters: {
              type: 'object',
              properties: {
                numDays: { type: 'numDays', description: 'number of days for the weather forecast' },
              },
              required: ['numDays'],
            },
            // reference to previously defined function
            function: getWeather,
          },
        ],
      }
    );
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;

title: Use KV API · Cloudflare Workers AI docs
description: Learn how to use Cloudflare Workers AI to interact with KV storage,
  enabling persistent data handling with embedded function calling in a few
  lines of code.

Interact with persistent storage to retrieve or store information enables for powerful use cases.

In this example we show how embedded function calling can interact with other resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform with a few lines of code.

## Pre-Requisites

For this example to work, you need to provision a [KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) namespace first. To do so, follow the [KV - Get started ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/get-started/)guide.

Importantly, your Wrangler file must be updated to include the `KV` binding definition to your respective namespace.

## Worker code

```ts
import { runWithTools } from "@cloudflare/ai-utils";


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
  KV: KVNamespace;
};


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    // Define function
    const updateKvValue = async ({
      key,
      value,
    }: {
      key: string;
      value: string;
    }) => {
      const response = await env.KV.put(key, value);
      return `Successfully updated key-value pair in database: ${response}`;
    };


    // Run AI inference with function calling
    const response = await runWithTools(
      env.AI,
      "@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b",
      {
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "Put user given values in KV" },
          { role: "user", content: "Set the value of banana to yellow." },
        ],
        tools: [
          {
            name: "KV update",
            description: "Update a key-value pair in the database",
            parameters: {
              type: "object",
              properties: {
                key: {
                  type: "string",
                  description: "The key to update",
                },
                value: {
                  type: "string",
                  description: "The value to update",
                },
              },
              required: ["key", "value"],
            },
            function: updateKvValue,
          },
        ],
      },
    );
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

## Verify results

To verify the results, run the following command

```sh
npx wrangler kv key get banana --binding KV --local
```

Oftentimes APIs are defined and documented via [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). The Cloudflare `ai-utils` package's `createToolsFromOpenAPISpec` function creates tools from the OpenAPI spec, which the LLM can then leverage to fulfill the prompt.

In this example the LLM will describe the a Github user, based Github's API and its OpenAPI spec.

```ts
import { createToolsFromOpenAPISpec, runWithTools } from '@cloudflare/ai-utils';


type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
};


const APP_NAME = 'cf-fn-calling-example-app';


export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {
    const toolsFromOpenAPISpec = [
      // You can pass the OpenAPI spec link or contents directly
      ...(await createToolsFromOpenAPISpec(
        'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mchenco/fd8f20c8f06d50af40b94b0671273dc1/raw/f9d4b5cd5944cc32d6b34cad0406d96fd3acaca6/partial_api.github.com.json',
        {
          overrides: [
            {
              matcher: ({ url }) => {
                return url.hostname === 'api.github.com';
              },
              // for all requests on *.github.com, we'll need to add a User-Agent.
              values: {
                headers: {
                  'User-Agent': APP_NAME,
                },
              },
            },
          ],
        }
      )),
    ];


    const response = await runWithTools(
      env.AI,
      '@hf/nousresearch/hermes-2-pro-mistral-7b',
      {
        messages: [
          {
            role: 'user',
            content: 'Who is cloudflare on Github and how many repos does the organization have?',
          },
        ],
        tools: toolsFromOpenAPISpec,
      }
    );


    return new Response(JSON.stringify(response));
  },
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
